﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ It has research (the first search) the scholars differed in it, is it one of the properties of this nation or not? The science of Abu Bakr al-Tunsi transferred the gathering of the scholars of every billion of the fact that God Almighty opened every book with it, and the one narrated that when he said: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. In the book: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, until the verse of the mourning came down, and he commanded a book in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful Al-Fatihah, and its suffering in the name, and the suffering of the bishop in the B, and if it were in the old books, it would not be the first thing to write it, and if it was the suffering of the Qur’an, and it was the suffering of the Qur’an, Country, so the obligatory, and in it that the matter is that detailing is not necessary to enforce the negation Driving, and the heavenly books with their families are a dispute of the abhorrent, other than Arabic, and what is in the Qur’an from it is incapable, so perhaps this is the entry of it, So do not be in the Qur’an, as the Sarimini deluded it, and if there is a bulk, on the first of the two signs, with its vicinity, it is an indication of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the The mothers of the questions until a group of chances of manufacture, the people were dispersed in the name, other than the mill, as it has some verse with the agreement of the first, the first of the words, It is a sign of the first light, (the second) is that it is a sign of all of it, uninterrupted, (the third) is that it is a sign of the conqueror without otherwise, (the lord) is that it is some of it. A clear verse, I was revealed to the heads of the light, and for the separation between it, (the sixth) is that it is permissible to make it a sign of it, and otherwise With the two descriptions, (the seven) is that it is some verse of all the lights, (the eighth) is that it is a sign of the conqueror, and the part of a verse of the light, (the ninth) is the opposite of it (the ninth). Film, and if it was revealed, the son of Abbas, the son of the blessed, and the people of Makkah as a lot, and the people of the kofa as a naked, the sake, and others, and others Al-Shafi’i and the Imamiyyah are on the second, and some of the Shafi’i said, and the garment and attributed to the Imam Ahmad with the third, and the people of the city and among them is your money, and the Levant, and the Levant, and the Levant, Omar and Jacob over the fifth, and he is the most famous of our people, and on the one who is a victory for it His nose, and I was before the Shafi’i preacher for me in conjunction My soul is only from it, and my heart has the deception of their sayings, as I had the heart of Qais, the one who is in the year, so that it is not advanced, and it is not late for it. I came to me before I know the passion, and he went to a empty heart, so we were able to do until I was not busy with the sayings of the Hanafi, and I stayed from it. And he took refuge with me from her love, what made me become a saying: “Her love was given to the love of the night, it was before it ∗∗∗ and it was a place that was not a solution from before and that is before. The article, and he wanted sixteen Hajj to prove that it is a verse from the conqueror as it is the text of his words, nor a translation of translation, for I am the best of God I am going to support God Almighty, and from him, and the victory, and I say: He said (p-40) (the first pilgrimage) narrated Al-Shafi’i, on the authority of Ibn Jari She said: «(قَرَأ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلّى اللَّهُ تَعالى عَلَيْهِ وسَلَّمَ فاتِحَةَ الكِتابِ، فَعَدَّ ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ a verse, ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ verse, ﴿الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ verse, ﴿مالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ﴾ verse, ﴿إيّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وإيّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ﴾ verse, ﴿اهْدِنا الصِّراطَ المُسْتَقِيمَ﴾ verse, ﴿صِراطَ الَّذِينَ أنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ المَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ ولا الضّالِّينَ﴾ verse), “This is a clear text, (the second pilgrimage), narrated by Said His father, on the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: «(فاتِحَةُ الكِتابِ سَبْعُ آياتٍ، أُولاهُنَّ: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾). (The third pilgrimage) Al-Thalabi narrated with his chain of transmission, on the authority of Abu Barada, on the authority of his father, he said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: «(ألا أُخْبِرُكَ بِآيَةٍ لَمْ تَنْزِلْ عَلى أحَدٍ بَعْدَ سُلَيْمانَ بْنِ داوُدَ غَيْرِي؟ فَقُلْتُ: بَلى، قالَ: بِأيِّ شَيْءٍ تَسْتَفْتِحُ القُرْآنَ إذا افْتَتَحْتَ الصَّلاةَ؟ فَقُلْتُ: بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ، قالَ: هي هِيَ)،» With his chain of transmission, on the authority of Jaafar bin Muhammad, on the authority of his father, «عَنْ جابِرِ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ أنَّ النَّبِيَّ صَلّى اللَّهُ تَعالى عَلَيْهِ وسَلَّمَ قالَ لَهُ: (كَيْفَ تَقُولُ إذا قُمْتَ إلى الصَّلاةِ؟ قالَ: أقُولُ: ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ he said: Say: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾), “And he also narrated with his chain of transmission on the authority of the mother of peace «أنَّ النَّبِيَّ صَلّى اللَّهُ تَعالى عَلَيْهِ وسَلَّمَ كانَ يَقْرَأُ: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾,” and he narrated what is also. He attributed his face that if he opened the surah in the prayer, he would read: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Bin Jabir, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, in his words, the Almighty: ﴿ولَقَدْ آتَيْناكَ سَبْعًا مِنَ المَثانِي والقُرْآنَ العَظِيمَ﴾ He said: The opening of the book, and it was said to Ibn Abbas: Where is the four? And he said: In the name of God, the Most Merciful, and with his chain of transmission, on the authority of Abu Hurairah, on the authority of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, he said: «(إذا قَرَأْتُمْ أُمَّ القُرْآنِ فَلا تَدَعُوا: بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ، فَإنَّها إحْدى آياتِها)،» Female: My servant found me, and if he said: ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ God said: He praised me, my servant, and if he said: ﴿الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ He said: He praised me to my servant, then if he said: ﴿مالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ﴾ God said: “He said:” He said: Between me and between my servants, and if he said: ﴿اهْدِنا الصِّراطَ المُسْتَقِيمَ﴾ God Almighty said: This is for my servant and for my servant what he asked), “And with his chain of chain, he heard the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, (O man, you cut off your soul, but you knew that ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ from praise, then whoever left it, you have left a verse of it, and whoever leaves a verse of it, then he has lost it. With it, whoever leaves a verse from it, then his prayers were lost), and with his chain of transmission on the authority of Talaha ibn Ubayd Allah, he said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers be upon him He greeted: «(مَن تَرَكَ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ فَقَدْ تَرَكَ آيَةً مِن كِتابِ اللَّهِ)». (The Fifth Hajj) Quda in the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful. The origin is that every letter of God be exaggerated, and if the letter is useful, the estimation is: Read the openness of the name of your Lord, and the best of the matter, and the best of the matter, The reading of the prayer, so it is necessary to prove it in the reading in it in the text of the text of the discontinuation. It is not written in the line of the Qur’an, not to see that they prevented the writing of my names in the Qur’an, and prevented the signs of the evils, and the fifth, (p-41) (P-41) To mix with the Qur’an, it is not a Qur’an, and if the Qur’an would not be from the Qur’an, they would not have written it in the Qur’an. Between the two burials, the words of God, the Almighty, and the name is the existence of them, so it is obligatory to make it from it. Al-Shafi’i said: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and Abu Hanifa said: It is not a verse, but ﴿صِراطَ الَّذِينَ أنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ﴾ is a verse, and we will not be the one who said: The verses are only seven by making the fullness of them a complete verse from them. Bayyan Al-Awal: that Abu Hanifah is Muslim that her readers are better, and if he is like you, then he is the most promising that he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him and his family, have read it. To say the Almighty: ﴿واتَّبِعُوهُ﴾ And if the garment proves that it is from the surah, because he does not say the difference, and he said to him, peace and blessings be upon him: «(كُلُّ أمْرٍ ذِي بالٍ لا يُبْدَأُ فِيهِ بِاسْمِ اللَّهِ فَهو أبْتَرُ)،» Al-Fatihah, the one who reads its readings, requires the fact that the prayer is action, and it is clear that it indicates the end of the decrease and the abundance of the deficiency. For the empty prayer for it in the end of the deficiency and the deficiency, and everyone who acknowledges that he said with corruption, and it indicates that it is from the conqueror. The point of view is that this indicates that this approach is a complete verse, and it is known that it is not a dumper in the teller, so it must be in the place of the lap Hadiyah is ten) on the authority of Anas that Muawiyah is the city, so he prayed with people a public prayer, so he read the mother of the Qur’an, and he did not read the luster, so he did not. The immigrants and the supporters from every side: I forgot, where: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The ritual prayer and the misery of it. (The second pilgrimage is ten) that the wicked of the prophets were at the hurricane in the works of good, they start in the name of God, and Noah said: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ مَجْراها﴾ ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ On our Messenger, this is the Almighty saying: ﴿فَبِهُداهُمُ اقْتَدِهِ﴾ And if this is proven in his right, it is also established in our right to say it to the Almighty: Fatah. (The third pilgrimage is ten) that it is an inferior and other than an event, so it is obligatory with the right of the rational appropriateness that it is his remembrance of the precedent, and the remembrance of it is the same. The remembrance is not obtained unless it is the reader of the precedent, and if it is proven that the saying of the duty of this urbanization, then what the believers saw, then it is good, then it is good, then it is good The reading is proven that it is a verse of Fatah, because he does not say the difference. (Four Hajj is ten) that there is no doubt that it is from the Qur’an in the surah of maste His Excellency said: “The day of the day is for the lying of the lying. (The Fifth Hajj is ten) Ruwa: «(أنَّهُ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ كانَ يَكْتُبُ: بِاسْمِكَ اللَّهُمَّ)» The hadith, and it indicates that the parts of this word are all of the Qur’an, its entirety of it, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is a reward for it, From the Qur’an, if it is permissible to leave it with these obligations, and the month, it was permissible to break the path of the verses, the first, and that is required to stab in the great Qur’an. (The sixth pilgrimage was ten) He showed us that it was proven by the frequency that God Almighty was descending this word on Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him. He commands her writing in the line of the Muhsaf in it, and indicated that the convergence is that he is required to read his readers? Is it permissible for the modern who touched it? So we say: The evidence of these rulings is more important, so the destiny is obligatory to him, for his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him: «(دَعْ ما يُرِيبُكَ إلى ما لا يُرِيبُكَ)،» He answered him, and some do not perform an argument for us, because the correctness is from our mind that in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, a transitional verse, and it is from the Qur’an, and it is from the Qur’an, and it is from the Qur’an. Its soul, and the many of us have been in prayer, and the Zayli mentioned in the explanation of the treasure: that the most correct is that it is obligatory, and the al-Zuhdi mentioned that it is the one that is the one who is the one who is the one who is the saheeh: (P-42) A duty in every rak'ah in which the reading is required, which is the correct novel from Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, and Ibn Wahban said in Mansoum Sahi every rak'ah ∗∗∗ He finds it, as it is positive, he said the most, and in the richness of the mantle: it is the one, and it is the most disagreement of the judge of Khan, and the owner of the abandonment, and others By following, and saying about some of this is that it is from The tyrants of the pen are the purpose of the tyrants, and an end in the fanaticism from the mastery, and we will speak to what this science mentioned on detailing, (so that it is not in detail): From the hadith of the mother of Salamah in the face, which was narrated by a violation of what is in the white, contrary to what is in the modern books, then he is answered by him that Abu Malik did not give him a listener. With his estimation of the contemporary, it is said: This memorization was not found in the famous, and perhaps we say in the sense of some of the narrations that come to the one who is in the authority of the one who is the one who is the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who is the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who comes to the one who is the one who comes to the one Ubayd, Ahmad, and Abu Dawood with a luxurious: «(كانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ يُقَطِّعُ قِراءَتَهُ آيَةً آيَةً ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ ﴿الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ ﴿مالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ﴾), “Ibn al-Anbari, and al-Bayahqi: «(كانَ إذا قَرَأ قَطَّعَ قِراءَتَهُ آيَةً آيَةً يَقُولُ: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ Then he stands, then he says: ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ He stands, then he says: ﴿مالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ﴾), “Ibn Khazimah, and the ruler with words: «(أنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صَلّى اللَّهُ تَعالى عَلَيْهِ وسَلَّمَ قَرَأ في الصَّلاةِ: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾, so he made it a verse ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ two, ﴿الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ three verses, ﴿مالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ﴾ He was shocked), “And Al-Darqqni is with the words: «(كانَ يَقْرَأُ: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ to the end of it, cut it through a sign of an emirate and its promise to the enemy of the Arabs, and he considered: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ and he did not return: ﴿عَلَيْهِمْ﴾),“ It is said: I have the same as the readers of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him. It is tired, and there is only a sign that it is a verse, and it is a Muslim, but it is from the Qur’an, and as for it is from the conqueror, no, and so in the third novel that it is the same. And he delivered it to read it in prayer, and he prepared it as a verse for its conquests on it, and it is our Muslim as well, which is the first verse of the Qur’an, and the second verse from it ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ and this is the fifth And the words were cut off, and the ritual narration is not a text that is also a sign of al-Fateh, as it is necessary for the meaning to be: the prayer of God, the Lord of God, and the blessed Some of the facts in the prayer or otherwise, nor always, neither a place nor the recovery from the book of God Almighty: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ to the end of them, that is, the verses cut them a verse, and it is not a matter of one, and it is not the same, and it is not. The Arabs are one, one, and it is considered ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ and it did not fall to it in the prayer, and to get acquainted with it otherwise, because of the prestige of the secrets and the rituals of the ideas, and from this one of us The prostration of the slave was attributed to those who left it, and may God’s prayers and peace be upon him removed, so he thought that it was not from the Qur’an to recover it in the parents of the messengers, And he did not stand on it, but prayed, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, that time, for the bodies of Al-Jawaz, and the number of imagination of something that contradicts what is there, but what is there, but there is no one, but there is no one, but there is no way The approach of the verse in the length and the shortcomings is the approach of the paragraphs, something desired in it, and the integrity of the seizures is not harmful, so where is the joys of the conquest, so it is necessary Tara’i is not necessary, and the time of the Sufis is in a verse and the adjective in another verse that is preceded by the example, and preceded the proverbs. Completely, and he stopped it on the condition of the concept of other things that are not angry, and on this, this was not proven in this (P-43) narration, and only that the narration is that it is from the narration, and it is only that it is the same. A Muslim with the two parties, and as for it is from the conqueror, then it is the abandonment of the murder. As for what he mentioned in the second pilgrimage from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, it was brought up by Al-Tabrani and Ibn Mardawi, and Al-Bayahqi with a memorial: «( ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ The second and the great Qur’an, which is the mother of the Qur’an, and it is the openness of the book), “And Darqatni brought it out with the words: «(إذا قَرَأْتُمُ الحَمْدَ، فاقْرَءُوا: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ It is the mother of the Qur’an, and the mother of the book, and the seventh of Her verses), “The meaning of the first narration ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ to the last verses seven verses, and with it the Hanafis said, and when God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, observed the delusion For the name with that semi-liking, it is not a verse of the Qur’an, this was removed from the face of a journey, and he said: ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ It is a verse of the Qur’an, and the meaning of the second: If you want to read the praise to the last of what it follows, then read before it ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾, that is, the praise to the other, the mother of the Qur’an, the mother of the Qur’an, The second, and this is the same as the illusion, or the desire, with the rule of ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ to the last, and its saying: and ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ one of its verses at the same time is mentioned in the sense of the first novel, and it is like the one, and it is like the Also in the readings of the name, and what we mentioned, and if it is in it, it is a metaphor, but we called for him to conduct the chest of speech on his right The perpetration of the metaphor in the chest is as it is not hidden, and it is the composition of the disagreement of the original before the pilgrim to it, and as for what it mentioned in the third pilgrimage, it is not the same as the evidence that it is the same, as it is the same, as it is the name of the name. We are among those who violate it in it, and as for what he mentioned in the four, the first hadith, the second, the third, and the sixth with its weakness, and the eighth do not indicate the meaning With what is indicated by him, and the four are eager to Ibn Abbas, and we do not surrender that his ruling is to raise the jurisprudence of the guidance. The street is like the knowledge of the surah, for example, and for that, they promised “the pain” where it was signed, and they did not count. It is a transmitted verse from the Qur’an, and strived and made it a verse from the conqueror, or we say: He said that also from a loyalty, but he thinks that he is the one who thinks it I have a doubt about his health with this memorization, and perhaps with the memorial that Darqatni brought him out, and a predecessor With his report, and I will not take care of the pride in the hadiths, and it is not from its memorizers, and I see it if it is transmitted in the meaning, and it is not for me, and it is not for me, and it is not possible for me to be. And the swallow is not the same as the words of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him This, and for my life, if it was correct, I would be satisfied with the Shafi’i, or they presented it on the path of their evidence, and he mentioned it to his chain of transmission to see it, and the one who is not. We receive that it is answered at the beginning of Al-Fatiha We are tired of Lebanon with its patronage, and the sixth pilgrimage is the strongest of what it inferred from it as the bearing of the Qur’an, and on the one that is from the conqueror, then it is not, and it is not. A Qur’an to speak in this sign, which is not satisfied by the righteous printing, the straightforward, and the fairness is the half of the religion, and the purpose of the truth is from the ethics of the believers The pictured pilgrimage is that we have no hide, and the eighth pilgrimage is the same as the proof of its orbit-and it is the tire of the words of our children, the father of Hanifah, the mercy of God-The ninth pilgrimage is like the fifth pilgrimage, the example of the calf with the caliph, and its use of its saying: (Every matter is a matter of mind), etc. The conquest of the comparative pride of the intention, which is a knee of it, so that it was not opened with the name, it was not the same, so it was not the same, so the ritual, and the ritual, and the ritual The servant will be in him to his Lord, each of them is a matter of mind, so if it is not open to the name, it was a void, then it is good to think that the knowledge of the knowledge was that he was the knowledge (P-44) His prayers, and when he kneeling and prostrating, and his resignations, the mercy of God, may He be exalted, and as for the prestigious argument, do not know that we have, The sharp pilgrimage is the same as the proximity of what is indicated by the appearance of it. Sallim from the immortality, and this is what they gave him until they emptied to see what the immortality is forced with the prostration of the pleasure or not, and I would like them to leave it and make it obligatory. Their synthesis of it in that prayer is also a kneeling, as Al-Shafi’i narrated itself as the pride passed by itself, that it is the one who is the same He reads ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ and he was not enlarged with the lightness to the kneeling and prostration, so when he delivered, the immigrants called him and the supporters: O Mua’awah, you stole from the prayer, and where ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾ When kneeling and prostrating? Then he returned the prayer With the name, and the arrogance, and this does not harm us, yes, the wickedness remains, and the search for it is hidden now, and the second argument is the same as the one that does not The part of the part is necessary that his saying: that the path of the prophets start with the hurricane with the tanks of goodness with the remembrance of God, so it is obligatory for us to do so And he inferred from him, upon which they were upon them, peace be upon them, with the words of the Almighty: ﴿أُولَئِكَ الَّذِينَ هَدى اللَّهُ فَبِهُداهُمُ اقْتَدِهِ﴾ The vow, and the third pilgrimage is ten, does not find it a benefit in our interviews as well, and in it what is in its sisters, and the remaining arguments are many of the past Except by the altercation of the Qarbas, and the tasks of the breaths, it is that some of what was mentioned by the opposition to what was left is a Muslim and others from the hadith of Abu Hiri, who said: I heard the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him. My servant found me, and if he said: ﴿إيّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وإيّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ﴾ God Almighty said: This is between me and between my servant, and my servant is what he asked, then if he said: ﴿اهْدِنا الصِّراطَ المُسْتَقِيمَ﴾ ﴿صِراطَ الَّذِينَ أنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ المَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ ولا الضّالِّينَ﴾ He said: This is my servant and the servant of my servant) The name is not from the conqueror, and that it is seven with it, as it made the mediator ﴿إيّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وإيّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ﴾ and the three before it to God Almighty, and the three after it to the servant, and for the sake of the slave, It is doubted that this novel is more correct than the narration of Al-Thalabi, and I do not present a fox over a Muslim, and also from the narration of Sajasini, and when he is the one who is the one who is the one who is from the one who is from it With an anomalous increase or a shortage of an abnormal hadith, and this is not from the door of negation and confirmation as he thinks of those who do not have it in this art, there is no steadfast The classification is from the numbers of fairness, as it is metaphor and there is no need for it, nor the villages of it, and make it a truth, but by adopting the supplication and the praise, it is lied to the enemy, and the one who is lying, Ibn Ma’in was weakened by him, so he is on the majesty of the man who does not hear and does not enrich from hunger, because the documented is many, and the hurry is presented to the no They are very moderate, and they have many, and the time of division is not for the conqueror and the bishop is shared with it with the unprepared of the shadow, not As it is for the characteristic, the parties are honored, and the one who is intended is some of the readings of prayer, as the phenomenon cannot be intended for the stretching of the work, and the fence of the surah, and the sacrifice, It is not something, as the one is that one is independent of a principle, a cut, and the second is existing, and the first is on our saying, and also the light, as well as the light. And the text of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was mentioned by the narrators of Abu Hurairah from him that the first is three verses, (P-45) and the second are thirty, and he stopped them, and he did not It is independent of the number or the part of the response, and on the stabilizer, and that it is, it is that it is returned to the second, its commitment to control the preacher, And the member is in its other hand, and the saying of Al-Razi is not far, and ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ is a verse that is a verse, and the part of another verse, as in ﴿وآخِرُ دَعْواهُمْ﴾ the verse, is far, but rather the void of the void For the part of there, there is a lot of here, and also the many from the light without a fullness, then it was after the hadith, and the hadith of the authenticity in the beginning of the ritual This excludes a verse from the surah or a part of a verse, and it was not descended after the second is excluded if the first is not excluded, and it is not the first, and the hadith is that it is not the first, and the hadith is not. With the power, but the constant, and it is formed by what was narrated that he was writing: in your name, O God, etc. The illegitimacy of the name of the name is a part of a wall of the innateness, as it is not hidden from those who delivered to him and his emotions, it is a verse of the Qur’an, and it is not an elaborate It is on the hadiths to stop in its Quran, or deny that it is the one who reads it, and it says with its teeth, so God, if it is full to me, the land is not for me. Monday-and the best of God Almighty-he enlightened it, how and the books of the hadiths are full of what is indicated by its disagreement, and it is the one who is correct for me from the imam, and the one who does not say that the imam is from the imam, and the one who says: With something, and how it does not provide for the last age in the same way as this dangerous matter, which is the one who has the prayer of prayer, from its health or its continuation, and it is possible that it is the one, and it is possible for it to be. And the matters of religions, such as divorce, sweetness, and commenting, which is the great imam, and the diligent feet, may God be pleased with him With her beard, she does not contradict her hide by following the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him. To hide with the evidence of what was said about it, they were not the most prominent of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful. With his chain of transmission: «(أنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صَلّى اللَّهُ تَعالى عَلَيْهِ وسَلَّمَ كانَ يُسِرُّ بِبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ، وأبا بَكْرٍ، وعُمَرَ، وعُثْمانَ، وعَلِيًّا رَضِيَ اللَّهُ تَعالى عَنْهُمْ)،» And it was narrated from Abdullah ibn al-Mughafil, and we do not recognize his weakness that he said: «سَمِعَنِي أبِي وأنا أقُولُ: بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ، فَقالَ: أيْ بُنَيَّ، إيّاكَ والحَدَثَ في الإسْلامِ، فَقَدْ صَلَّيْتُ خَلْفَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلّى اللَّهُ تَعالى عَلَيْهِ وسَلَّمَ، وخَلْفَ أبِي بَكْرٍ، وعُمَرَ، وعُثْمانَ فابْتَدَءُوا القِراءَةَ بِـ ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ So if you pray, then say: ﴿الحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العالَمِينَ﴾ Mudhab Al-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Ibn Masoud, Ibn Al-Zubayr, and Ammar Bin Yasser, and Al-Hassan Ibn Abi Al-Husayn, Al-Shaabi, Al-Nakhi, Al-Azziz, Al-Alam, Al-Zahri, Mujahid, and Ahmad, And others are a great creation, and the hadiths of Al-Jahr were not valid from them except the hadith of Ibn Abbas, who was brought up by Al-Shafi’i from him: «(كانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلّى اللَّهُ تَعالى عَلَيْهِ وسَلَّمَ (p-46)يَجْهَرُ بِبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ)،» and he is opposed to what is presented to him, Sometimes he detects it to be read in it as the age of God, may God be pleased with him, has been blessed with teaching, and as the wicked, the phenomenon was made to A custody of the exile, not for the negation, so it does not contradict, on the authority of some of the memorizers, there is no hadeeth in the wilderness except in its chain of transmission, and it is an article, and it is a matter of it Al-Jahir, so some money was divided upon him, so that the authenticity is known to him, and he said: It was not valid in Al-Jahr a hadith, and the saying is that the narration is from the one who is a sixth The wicked and the most hidden, for the fear of the children of the illiterate of those who disagreed with me, may God bless him and grant him the Almighty, as the wickedness does not harm us, as he is the one who will be hurt, as it is presented to us. Here is what we agree, as it is on the condition of the two sheikhs, and the accusation of the one who violates the lies on the people of my liar. Lies to the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and presented his companions. * * * (And from the wonders of Al-Razi) how to show the accusation of the accusation, and the symptoms of the people of the city are narrated on the master of the Malak of the children of the mother of that of the righteous, the good, Fear, silence, and wonder, and the most arrogant than this is that he mentioned six arguments to prove the wickedness is more hidden from the nomadic, (the first) that the name is from the surah, and it is the authority of it. And the one is confidential, some are a jurisprudence, and it is returned by what you taught in the Raddouds, and by the exposure of it, it is from the surah, that is, what is forbidden from the bit, And the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, did it, “Follow him” and perhaps the secret in it is like the secret in the wickedness and the concealment in the rak'ahs of one prayer, or it is said: The Qur’an was a first cell, and a second generosity, as it is his condition, but if you contemplate his words, the Almighty in the hadith that is fixed when the people of God: «(كُنْتُ كَنْزًا مَخْفِيًّا)» The greatest, may God be exalted from the Mujahid Al-Qudam, (the second) is that it is praise and greatness, so it is necessary to announce it because of its saying: ﴿فاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكم آباءَكم أوْ أشَدَّ ذِكْرًا﴾ Likewise, I will see it. (Third) The wickedness of the remembrance of God indicates the inspiration with it, and the extent of the indifference of its denial, and it is an improved mind, so it is like that He said: This is a powerful argument in myself, is established in my mind. The option is not a little bodil. The destiny is hidden, and that is the best of Layli, and my hair is that God praised him in his kneeling and his prostration is defective, so he will be hidden, or a good man With the man except for good, the pilgrim is strong in itself is a firmness in his mind (the four) what Al-Shafi’i brought out from Anas that Mu’awiya, the righteousness of the family, In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, so the migrants and the supporters were supposed to be, so the hadith was restored in its meaning, and his opponents returned, or it is said: He did not read it, and he did not read it. With some readers and what is behind, whoever heard. (Fifth) What Al-Bayhaqi narrated from Abu Hurairah: «(كانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ يَجْهَرُ في الصَّلاةِ بِبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ)،» He is the narrator on the authority of Omar and his son, Ibn Abbas, and Ibn Al-Zubayr, and on the authority of Ali, whoever is in his life To me, he has lost, and the opponent and the estimation of his negation are said: The wicked was sometimes a wiseness, and in the news that we mentioned, what is also exhibited to the one who is also exhibited And Ibn Abbas, and what has been beneficial for his attribution to a variety of people with the people of the Sunnah. One of the whole of what they claim (P-47) is his frequency from the Emir as disbelief, so there is nothing but faith in one another and the disbelief in one another, and what he mentioned is that whoever is killed in his religion But if he greeted us, he would have told us what he had to be upon him, may God be exalted, and without him his tasks, and he will be carried on the fact that the goodness is the family of the Sunnah They differed when the friend had to be, where the Prophet ﷺ is upset in the specialization to him, so he said first: «(أصْحابِي كالنُّجُومِ، بِأيِّهِمُ اقْتَدَيْتُمُ اهْتَدَيْتُمْ)،» and secondly: «(عَلَيْكم بِسُنَّتِي، وسُنَّةِ الخُلَفاءِ الرّاشِدِينَ المَهْدِيِّينَ بَعْدِي)،» and third: «(اقْتَدُوا بِاللَّذَيْنِ مِن بَعْدِي أبِي بَكْرٍ وعُمَرَ )،» and in the way: «(إنْ لَمْ تَجِدِينِي فَأْتِي أبا بَكْرٍ )». (Sixth) that it is attached to an inner act that is like: with insulting the name of God, they are seemed, and there is no doubt that the wondering of this word is the one who does not God is only with the grace of God, and there is no power on the obedience of God except by the success of God, and his alert is that he does not have anything from the good, unless it is a matter An order with a well-known, and he returns it with the ride of this estimation and a number of saying that the understanding of the matter with the known from this sentence needs a thought, for the sake of the His Excellency said: ﴿إيّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وإيّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ﴾ He made a weakness of his weakness without a lot of great absence, so he sings from him, and then he has mercy on him And the exemption of the student is the most important of the students. (The third research is in its costume), so it is either: for use, or accompanying, or adhesion, or the sequel, or increased, or division, and the fourth of the brother I seek to see some of the verses, and it is more likely to be more likely from the first, for which he feels the words of the first of the first By making it to use it, he feels that he has an increase in an income in the verb until it is as if he does not come to him and is not found without the name of God, and he does not, and he does not Al-Zamakhshari is the second, and it is supported by the fact that the accompaniment is more in the recovery from the B is of use, not in the suffering, and what runs through the path of the verb, The Almighty is a discipline with him, and a greatness for him, with the disagreement of making it for the family, for it is a slander that is not intended to Blessing, then we will respond to them in that, and that the B is carrying the accompaniment, it was evidenced by all the parts of the verb of the deeds of the name of God. The machine, and it is caused by what was narrated in the hadith: «(تَسْمِيَةُ اللَّهِ تَعالى في قَلْبِ كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ يُسَمِّي أوْ لَمْ يُسَمِّ)،» And that the blessing in the name of God is the same as a phenomenon that is understood by every one, who begins with it, A family is not afflicted with an accurate look, and if the name of God is the Almighty to do the verb, it is not only with the admission that it is connected to it with the blessing Blessing, let us transfer it first, and if his name is made, he is a machine for the sacrifice of the conqueror, and it does not come to the one who says: The name of the surah is the one who says: Ali and peace be upon him: «(بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لا يَضُرُّ مَعَ اسْمِهِ شَيْءٌ)،» What he is forgotten by him, and in the first he made the muddam a sense like the one His path was the path of the pen, so it would not be a reader, and it is a reader, and it has briefing and communicating with the conversion of the memorization to the multiplicity of the meaning of the one who is the one, To be it immediately, in which there is a way of the act of the subject, and it has been proven that every act is close to it to God to God, whoever helps him, and the situation of the situation, and the situation, and the situation, so that the situation is, so the situation, and the case, The use of the first, but it is almost a certainty, as it has literature, the possibility, and the purification of the servants is not in the case of accompanying, and because it is in it, and that it is in it. Absolute and powerful, and the negation of the extent of the destiny of worship, and its effects, and it is an openness to the door of the mercy, and a jurisprudence with a treasure, there is no power, no power With his saying: ﴿وإيّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ﴾ And because it is like the one who is appointed in his saying: ﴿اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ﴾ so that he will be an answer to his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him: «(لَسْتُ بِقارِئٍ)» The support of the accompanying all of it is a new one, (as the first), because without proof of the majority, the mandate of the murder, (as for the second), because it is a delusion that has arisen from the people With the senses, and not all sorrows with a domesticated machine, and there is no doubt about the health that I sought refuge in God, and he was returned in the law, he said: ﴿اسْتَعِينُوا بِاللَّهِ واصْبِرُوا﴾ (P-48) passes, and the heart has surrounded its flaws, another side, and also in the specialization of the use of the family, because it may be, and it will be with it, What is forbidden from the indication of it here that it is the one who is intended by the self, so it is intended by the present, as there is no power or power except with it. (As for the third), it is that the partners are used to the gods of their gods, close, as they are their mediators in the approach to it, and it is more likely to be a family. (As for the lord), because the machine is inevitable in every part to the last verb, otherwise it is not fulfilled, and we do not recognize the obligation between the affairs of anything For all its parts, and what he mentioned from the hadith, it is the use of it. As for the heads that were held by the heart of every Muslim who is called or was not named. (As for the fifth), because if he wanted that the meaning of the accompanying blessing, the heroes appeared, and he returned with a hidden one, and if he wanted to understand it, then he would understand it, then he would understand it. With it, if the verse is intended to stop the legitimacy on it, and as for the blessing of the blessing, it is an apparent meaning of each one, so we do not accept that it is from the one who is the one) Because the blockade has a variety, and the swallow is because the thing is opened by the thing, there is no prevention from it as part, so the conquest is the openness of the Qur’an, So he made her openness to the lineage to what he prepared. (As for the eighth), because the meaning of the hadith: I do so, seeking help from the name of God, who does not harm me with the remembrance of his name, seeking him with something, for what is for him, for the sake of it. His door kept it, and it was preserved, and if I followed this, and I repeated what was said in the response that what is meant by the hadith is that it does not harm with the remembrance of the name of the name A matter with her, we have: And her is a news of the exile of the companions of the circle, the companions of the benefit and the blessing are understood, and it is the motivation of the chaos from the reader with the reward of the reward, so there is no Imported people, and it does not mutilate us, as we have not forgotten it with a lot, (as for the ninth), because he made the supply like the one who is the one who is the one who is on the one And the joke is that the name of God likened the name of the believer to what was returned from the Sunnah and the cutting with its necessity with the command, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same It brings out the exaggeration of the metaphor for its fall into the letters. (As for the tenth), because it is not hidden from the likeness We receive that the blessing is the meaning of accompanying or necessary with its meaning, but it is known from an outstanding matter, which is that the accompaniment of his name is his grace, with it, and he is in it, and he is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor, and it is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor, and he is a neighbor. He was in the use of what is not hidden, and it can be after the time of the choice of the Zamakhir The servant with his act, so he and his companions went to him, and he will come if God wills his response, and he was disagreed with the attachment of the neighbor, so the imam went to the son Because his next is a lengthy, and so is the verb of the verb every act of act, making the name a principle for him, and it is one of the Qur’anic suffering, as a person who is in the man The tongue, and with it, the words of the Sadqi are driven, and the intended is not here It is presented to the reader of this reader, but rather his existence, and the saying comes with its part of all or parts without hidden, and when it is hidden from that The action of a matter is directed to worshipers, so that the saying of the charitable and the estimated, and the choice of the deceased from a choice, and narrated from Ibn Abbas because it is the one who is the one who is the one who He urges worshiping to do so, which is the appropriateness for learning, and the grammarians went to its estimation in general, as it is the same: starting and supporting it from it: It is valid in all of the name without the act of readings, and the estimation of the public is the first, not to see them appreciate the attachment of the neighboring neighbor, or a row, or the case, or the case And the stability where it was signed, and they affected it for the general health of its estimation. (And from it) that it is resigned by the abuse of the name, and it is its initiative, so it is possible to fall into the lapha It is also in the vicinity of it, and the name is not in it, in which it is in it, and it is the appearance of the verb in the words of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: 103] His Excellency said: ﴿اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ﴾ Because the most important is the reader, it is not an perspective in it to its beginning, and that is why the action was presented, and so is not in the name. And what the Imam is gone to, a mother, and the one who is intended, and it is a result of which, it requires that the readers are located in its costs, a chair of the name of the name, the name of the name of the name Qaddad: start, as you do not offer him to that, and what was mentioned first of the consultation by the ability of the grammarians and the restriction, so it is not for them, so it is not good, so it is not good, so it is not good, so it is not good. Where they do not mean a worker with his eyes, but they want to speak on the worker from where he is, so they are their representatives with good, and Omar, not for the sake of the word Example, so be close To understanding, and it is not said if the actor is inspired, it is appreciated by the fact that the appeal here is not the best of the readers, because what is meant by it is the righteousness The first, the middle, and the last, and the one who is the first of the first, is the first, for this is the universe and the stability that the grammarians, as the grammar, are the ones, when it is presented, It is a descendant of the obligatory, but it is known as the position of the shrine that the beginning of it is the reader, or by adopting the origin of the worker in the whole, then it is not hidden from it, then it is hidden from it. His will, as it is meaning to download it, is a house that is obligatory at that time, and it is his affection for the memorial and the original. The vigor is resigned by the extent, and it is not a Muslim, and we have provided that the readers are the most important and the most comprehensive, and the fall in the beginning of the beginning is a verb, not to add the ritual The intended for him has something to be distressed to him, as he prayed and began with the pride of the warning, he does not need in his place to be a guest, but it is a matter For all of what he did, and from this, what is in the rest of the words appears from the weakness, (as for what is mentioned third), then it is that the time of the name is starting with it, and it is not the same. The hadith is mentioned by the fact that every matter of money was not said, or he never guarantees it in the name of God, so it is like this that the preservation is on the authority of the hadeeth, but it is not the same. A disintegration in the words of the manifestations, and whoever is overwhelmed in their validity, not in the words of God The estimation of the general verb, as a start or a sacrifice, and what they liked, not in the way of the privacy, I read, I mean, its source of reading is on the authority Its export is a mobility, so it is mentioned by the laws of literature and the position of the conflict. And some went to the estimation: my predecessor, for example, and in it the increase in addition, for the duty of the news of the news at that time, then the host will be three words, and the consequences of the ritual Displaced by the one who is harmed by the appealing of the place, except that the violation between the two sentences remains the name and the pharmacist, and the matter, and the matter, The older sheikh is sanctified by this neighbor, a destructive, guaranteed news, it is the beginning of the world, and its appearance, because the provision of the divine names, and it is the authority of the god Related to what is after him, as God does not exalt only with his names as a matter of signal, so he does not look at it to the back, and it is not feared with the rituals, and I do not see the rituals, Many until the attribution of the comment is here a delay, because the name of God is the Almighty It is presented to the verb himself, so let the verb (P-50) be mentioned, and it has a sign of the luminous betting, and it is an honorable of the Annual betting, and therefore he said some of the people: Except and I saw God before him, and you will give you the same as the time of this name, and he will be upon his weaning from the breastfeeding of the sake of the sake of the sake, Confusion is a joy with importance, and if we say that in the progress, we cut off the raging of the kakah in response to those who claim it as the place of the message, and the appearance of the sake of the day A verse that has come down, as the place is that there is a place of prophecy, nor a response, and do not get it in it, and for every place an article, and the rhetoric: the custodian of the words to the requirement of the situation, The shortage is brought to him to think of the remembrance of the seal, until some of them claimed it with its three types, and the bit of one was lost, so it was confined to the palace, And in the heart, and in the heart of everything, and here it is appreciated by the largest, and the most said, and the most recently is delayed from the yard of the investigation, for the sake of the investigator B is, or after a name, or after the name of God, or after the distance, either it is estimated after the B. It does not say it to those who know the b. As for after the name, it would be chapter, and if it is reasonable, where they answered the deletion here between the two of the two, but after the name of God, then the name of God is the name of God Between the adjective and the descriptions, and between the two gravity, it expands the abundance, and after the completion, it appears a minimal shortage, because in the sentence of the ritual With the high, the Most Merciful was a cause for the restricted rule in the name of God, then if the rented worker is delayed, and it is done, and it is done, and it is done. Its face appears, and if we appreciate the worker, it is presented as it is the basis of the warning, and it will get a choice as well, as it was said, for example: I read it, or the one The Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, and the abandonment of the cause, the remedy of the rhetorical position is required, if the cause of the other appears, there is no other cause, then it is not the same When he said with the understanding of the adjective, so he feels that those who did not describe this outside of the circle, and the restriction here is not like the time, and there is no one. Pupping: seeking in the name of God, because the Most Merciful is the Most Merciful, I read in it what is not hidden from the ritual ritual, and in the urbanization of the juvenile, and it is a reason, and it is permissible, Something in the phenomenon, which is transmitted, except for the old name, a hidden symbol to the accusative of the constant in the knowledge, and if it is not on the authority of God, the exalted of God, for God, for the exalted The divorced woman, and the appearance of something like it, and everything That is committed, and the blessing is like the obligatory, it requires the progress with the remembrance of broken, not guaranteed, and here it is as you see, and from the greatest of those who said: I have not seen anything Solutions, and I have been fully fully than the first, and the rituals are four, and the womb wears you. A delayed opinion ﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ مَجْراها﴾, «(وبِاسْمِكَ رَبِّي وضَعْتُ جَنْبِي)،» and their proverbs, so he passed its wages, and the difference is an apparent view of the views, and this is one of the women of the magic, so he wakes up to him, and he sleeps from others. And the definition is stable at some, and a linguist at one another, and it has been violated in their interpretation, so it was said: The prostitution is what is its worker, and the one who is unknown, His work is deleted, divorced, and it was said: The stable is what his worker is general, such as crops, and the stability, and it is estimated, and the language of its differences, and it is said: the absence On the other hand, it is not understood from it, whether it is mentioned or not, and the stable is what it understood from the meaning of his powerful factor that is from the general verbs, and all of you In it, the choice of the first, so the custody is here, so that the worker was estimated, but the Baa and the right of the virtuous are broken to be open to the one who opened it, and it is open to the one who opened it. To his heavily, and his being is an interview for the good Arabs, the silence of its hidden, and its enemy, but it is from where it is the words of the words of it. With the poor, an excuse or an insulting, the right of the conquest, as it is the brother of the tranquility in the subtle light in the many ways to the elderly of the people of the time The letter, and the run, and each of them is appropriate for the fracture. Not in the forefathers except rare, it is appropriate for the numbers, and the neighbor, for the argument of the movement of the impact of the impact, and we do not undermine the waves of kindness to the perfection, nor the custody of the ritual For the reward, because the group caused the hunting, and it was not found in every, but the abuse is met, or the division and its waters, and it is obligatory that its work is in the wildness of the wise, in the wise. As if the neighbor is not a trace of them, and this is a grammar, and it is a result after the occurrence of an occasion, so you do not carry a discussion of the weakening of the time The one who loves and its covenant ∗∗∗ is a weakening of the pilgrimage, so we do not purify the eyelids of the thought in it and on it, and some of them said in the regard of the sign: To connect to God Almighty and to comment on his names by breaking the garden, subjugation and humiliation of the servants, so it is not connected to the types of types of knowledge, and the kindness of the knowledge, As he referred to that, Master Omar Bin Al-Fid, God sanctified his excess secret. With his saying: If you were from the point of the B, you were raised to what you did not have with a trick, where you see that you do not see what you have prepared ∗∗∗ The reduction meets raising, so whoever reduces him to the humiliation of slaves, raised by Al-Qadr to the view of the glory of the grapes, and this ram is not attained, but it is a ritual The Glorious Divine Tribes, and whoever descends to benefit, then it will be revealed, and his endeavor is not acceptable, ended. It is a matter specialized in the bonds, and it cannot be running in the Bi-Jarat divorced, as it is not hidden, and when I am in the secret of that, the B is the ritual of the second to the second. The stable and the ritual of the paths, it is a reference to the right to the right, and the W. Either indicate its attributes that the point of the colors appeared, and that is what was said to the universal point Al-Shibli: You are the young? He said: I am the point under the B is, and the older Sheikh said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The ugliest slave that we mixed ∗∗∗ that is the tap of the right of the truth, so they were considered ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The first for the first is as it refers to the hadith: «(سَبَقَتْ رَحْمَتِي غَضَبِي)،» The epidemic of the neighbor is a sign of it, because it is the mediator in the addition, and the overflow, so it is appropriate to the fracture, and the wing was reduced to the wing, The appeal about it here is a miracle of the badness, and the symbol that the orbit is the mercy as he said ﷺ: «(لَنْ يُدْخِلَ أحَدَكُمُ الجَنَّةَ عَمَلُهُ، قِيلَ: حَتّى أنْتَ يا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ؟ قالَ: حَتّى أنا، إلّا أنْ يَتَغَمَّدَنِي اللَّهُ بِرَحْمَتِهِ)،» And the grace of it and the transgression of its convergence, and the righteousness of it, and the exaltation of it, Passing the Most Merciful, and the reference to the Muhammad, and the first appointment referred to it by saying it ﷺ: «(أوَّلُ ما خَلَقَ اللَّهُ نُورُ نَبِيِّكَ يا جابِرُ )،» and with the authority of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same For your loyalty, I did not create the orbits, and to be the predominance of it, peace and blessings be upon him, the adjective of the mercy, but not to the nation’s believers, as it indicates to him: ﴿وما أرْسَلْناكَ إلا رَحْمَةً لِلْعالَمِينَ﴾ ﴿بِالمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَحِيمٌ﴾ It is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, and a great desire, and it may also be trained in the shadow of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him. ﴿وإنَّكَ لَعَلى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ﴾ He was satisfied with the symbols here, because of the appearance of the effects of the effects after, and the first sickness is a drop, then it is wounded, and there is no surah unless it opened it (p-52) He was glorified and delivered to him, and with the evil of the one who has heard and he is a martyr, and when the majesty was in Surah, it is unjust, he left the sign with the name, and he came to the case, And the relaxation of the stirring on the Arabs of the camels, and the grace of the ritual and the symbolism did not leave the college to the Muhammad al-Muhammad The hijab, and its successor is a great secret, and God is the Almighty to the way. And the name is the Basris of the ten names that were built on the silence, which is: a son, a son, a son, a name, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, and a two, and two, And the faith of God, and the faith of God from him, otherwise it is one tenth if it is accustomed to a sons, then if they are pronounced with it, they will be a prodigy of the ugliness of the people, and it is the same It is obeyed, and the matter is a sacrifice, which is what he has deleted, as well, and what is the last of the last three of what was presented. And the origin of it is a poison, the waw was relieved of a lot of the recovery, and for the punishment of the movements, the coffee of the cinema and the heat of the mim, and the heart of the mouth of the waters And he scrub it to the names, the name and the name of the scents and the name, and I called it to testify to it, and the wound with the heart is not accepted, and its detection is from the heavens, as it is the heavens, as it is On his name, he is raised from the hidden menstruation to the atom of the back and evacuation.

Exclusively for itself and the connection of it, as it is an exclusive, and the modes are like the part of the origin without the connection. Rather, the waw turned a gossip as a lion and a scarf, and then he used it, so his thym was made, a gossip, and a stroke, and the harm was cut off, And in it there are languages that some reach to the twenty-year A smile like this is a sky with a period of this first, and it was prolonged that the name is the name of the name or other than it?

He liberated, and that he did not see it with the capacity of this The question is what is in the fridge of the breasts, nor the healing of the glorious, and the mercy of God has not come in his footnotes on the good one by himself, with something that I will join.
