The Quranic researcher (P-39) in the name of God, the Most Merciful, in which the research (the first search) was the scholars in which it was dispersed, is it one of the properties of this nation or not?The science of Abu Bakr al -Tunsi transferred the gathering of the scholars of every billion of the fact that God Almighty opened every book with it, and the one narrated that when he said: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.To descend: in the name of God, it will be pleased with it, and he commanded a book: in the name of God, until we descend: Say: Call God or pray the Most Merciful.The verse of the mourning, so he commanded a writing in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.The Ba, if it were in the old books, I would not have commanded the first thing to write it, and the suffering of the Qur’an was in every book, and the obligatory is not, so it is the same Difference is not obligated to enforce the negation of science, then, and not The absence is not an Arabic, and there is no income in the Qur’an, so that this is a whole, and it is an income in the insults of all suffering, so you will not be in the way Sarini, and if there is a bulk, on the first of the two signs, with its vicinity, indicative of the predecessors of the property, (the second search), which is one of the mothers of the people, which is the mothers of the people.By manufacturing, the people differed in the name in other than the mill, as it has some significance by agreement on ten sayings, (the first) that it is not from the one) A verse of all of it is not light, (the third) is that it is a sign of the conqueror without its other, (the four) is that it is some of it only from it, (the fifth) is that it is a good thing.The two heads of the light have to sleep, and the separation is between them, (the sixth) is that it is permissible to make it a sign of it, and it is not a verse to repeat its descent, and it is the same.Some of the whole lights, (eight) is that it is a verse from the conqueror, and the part of a verse from the light, (the ninth) reflects it, (the tenth) is that it is the verses of the vast Ibn Abbas, Ibn al -Mubarak, the people of Makkah as a lot, and the people of the kofa as a hand, and the sake, and others, and only a hamza, and the majority of the companions of the one who said: Some of the Shafi’iyyah, the garbage and the attribution of the Imam Ahmad with the third, the people of the city and the money of them, the Levant, and from them the first of them Mashour from We are gone, and on the authority of his view of it, and the volatility of it, and that by establishing the arguments on its proof and distraction I have a conquest, and I am no longer myself except from it, and my heart has gone out of their sayings, as I have the heart of Qais, for the sake of the year, so that there is no one.I came to me before I know the passion, and he went to a empty heart, so we were able to do until I was not busy with the sayings of the Hanafi, and I stayed from it.And he took refuge with me from her love, what made me become a saying: “Her love was given to the love of the night, it was before it ∗∗∗ and it was a place that was not a solution from before and that is before.The article, and he wanted sixteen Hajj to prove that it is a verse from the conqueror as it is the text of his words, nor a translation of translation, for I am the best of God I am going to support God Almighty, and from him, and the victory, and I say: He said (p-40) (the first pilgrimage) narrated Al-Shafi’i, on the authority of Ibn Jari That she said: “(The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, read, and the book of the book, so he prepared in the name of God, the Most Merciful A verse, the money of the Day of Religion is a verse, you are worshiped and we seek a verse, the guidance of the straight path is a verse, the path of those who have been blessed with them, nor do you not have The lost verse), “This is a clear text, (the second pilgrimage) narrated Saeed al -Muqabiri, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace The book is seven verses, the first of God: in the name of God, the Most Merciful).(The third pilgrimage) Al -Thalabi narrated with his chain of transmission, on the authority of Abu Barada, on the authority of his father, he said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: One of Solomon, Bin Dawood, is other than me?(Al -Hijab Al -Rabbi) Al -Thalabi narrated with his chain of transmission, on the authority of Jaafar bin Muhammad, on the authority of his father, “On the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah, that the Prophet, may God bless the Prophet, said: (How do you say if you rise to the prayer?He, upon him be upon him, was read: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful In prayer, he reads: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Its readers were deficient, and he also narrated his chain of transmission, on the authority of Saeed bin Jabir, on the authority of Ibn Abbas in his saying: He said: And he came to you.The opening of the book, then it was said to Ibn Abbas: Where is the seven?And he said: In the name of God, the Most Merciful The Most Merciful, it is one of its verses), “And with its chain of transmission, too, on the authority of Abu Hurairah,” on the authority of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, he said: He said: And among the servants of two descriptions, then if he said: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Al -Rahim said: I praised my servant, so if he said: The money of the Day of Religion said, God Almighty said: He delegated to me my servant, and if he said: We do not worship you, and he said: And if he said: We guided us the straight path In the mosque, and the Prophet speaks his companions when he entered a man praying, so the prayer opened, and he was referred to, then he said: Praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds, so he heard the Prophet, and he heard the Prophet.And he greeted that, and he said to him: (O man From it, his prayers were cut off on him, because there is no prayer except with it, so whoever leaves a verse from it, then his prayers have been prolonged), and with his chain of transmission on the authority of God, he said: May God’s prayers and peace be upon him: “Whoever is left in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.(The Fifth Hajj) Quda in the name of God, the Most Merciful, and a duty in the first of the Fatih, and if it is like that, it must be a sign of it, (the first of the first is the one who says: A link because the origin is that every letter of God is a dedication, and if the letters are useful, the estimation is: Read the opening of the name of your Lord, and the best of your Lord, It is proven in the other places of prayer, so it must be proven in the readers in it in the form of the text of the text.It is not from the Qur’an, because it is not written by the Qur’an, not to see that they prevented the writing of Asami al-Suwar in the Muhsaf, and prevented from the signs on the tenth All of them are forbidden to mix with the Qur’an, which is not a Qur’an, so if it would not be The name is from the Qur’an, as they wrote it in the Qur’an.(The Seven Hajj) The Muslims are collected on the fact that what is between the two burials, as the words of God Almighty, and the name is exerted between them, so it is necessary to make it from it.(The eighth Hajj) The path of those who have been blessed with a verse, and we will notice that his saying is weak, and then it is possible that the verses are not seven except by making it.(The ninth pilgrimage) that we say: the reading of the name before the conqueror and a duty, so it is obligatory to be a sign of it, the first Bayan: that Abu Hanifa is a greeting, and if it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the first: Likewise, it is the most promising that he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him and his family, read it, so it is obligatory for us to read it for us to say that it is up to him: The surah, because he does not say the difference, and his saying to him, peace and blessings be upon him: “(Every matter with a mind in which he does not start in the name of God, then he will be) Al -Fatihah, the one who reads its readings, requires the fact that the prayer is action, and it is clear that it indicates the end of the decrease and the abundance of the deficiency.The empty prayer for it in the end of the deficiency and the deficiency, and everyone who acknowledged that he said with corruption, and it indicates that it is from Fatah.(Al -Hijjah Al -Ashira) What was narrated is that the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said to Abi Bin Kaab: (What is the greatest verse in the Qur’an?The Prophet believed him in his saying, and the face of the question is that this indicates that this approach is a complete sign, and it is known that it is not in fullness in the noms It is not, and only the conqueror.(The sharp pilgrimage is ten) on the authority of Anas that Muawiyah is the city of the city, so he prayed with people a public prayer, so he read the mother of the Qur’an, and he did not read the rituals, so he said: The immigrants and the supporters from every aspect: I forgot, where: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.So he returned to the prayer and made it back.(The second pilgrimage is ten).The Most Merciful, do not be up to me, and it is obligatory to be upon our Messenger, so to say it to the Almighty: So, with them, they will be able to imitate it, and if it is proven in his right, it will be proven in his right, Hope: “Follow it” and if it is proven in our right, it is proven that it is a verse of the Fateh Surah.(The third pilgrimage is ten) that it is an inferior and changed, so it is obligatory for the right of the mind to be His remembrance is a precursor to the remembrance of others, and the precedent in the remembrance is not obtained unless the reader is a precedent.The believers are good, then it is good for God, and if the readers are fixed, it is proven that it is a sign of Fatah, because he does not say the difference.(Four Hajj is ten) that there is no doubt that it is from the Qur’an in the surah of maste His Excellency said: “The day of the day is for the lying of the lying.(The fifth pilgrimage is twenty) narrated: “(peace be upon him was written: in your name, O God,” the hadith, and it indicates that the parts of this word are from the words of all of them It is proven in it, so the reward is obligatory that it is from the Qur’an, if it is permissible to leave it with these merits, and the month is that it was permissible to leave the sake of the verses of the verses.The great Qur’an.(The sixth pilgrimage was ten) He showed us that it was proven by the frequency that God Almighty was descending this word on Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.He commands her writing in the line of the Muhsaf in it, and indicated that the convergence is that he is required to read his readers?Is it permissible for the modern who touched it?So we say: I prove these rulings is the most important, so the destiny is obligatory for him, for his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him: And there is nothing, because some of it is answered by it, and some do not perform an argument for us, because the correctness is from our opinion that in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Merciful It was not from the conqueror itself, and many of us have been brought up in the prayer, and the Zili mentioned in the explanation of the treasure: that the most correct is that it is obligatory, and it is a meant, and it is a meant.The authenticity is that it (P-42) is a duty in every rak'ah in which the readers are obligated, and it is the correct narration from Abu Hanifa, may God be pleased with him, and he said: Ibn Ibn Wahn.Sahi was not lined with every rak'ah ∗∗∗ and he prostrates, as it is positive, he said the most, and in the richness of the mantle: it is the one, and it is the most reliability of the judge of Khan, and the owner of the sake, I have the right to follow up, and say about some of this is that it is a tyrant of the edition of the tyrant, and an end in the fanatic Differentiation, (so he says): As for what he mentioned in the first pilgrimage from the hadith of the mother of peace in the face, which he narrated, it is contrary to what is in the good man who is in the man That Abu Malika did not prove his hearing from the mother of peace, and by his estimation of the contemporary, it is said: This is the memory There is no existence in the famous, and perhaps he was transferred in the sense of some of the narrations that come on the basis of what he was appointed to, so he was brought out by the father of Ubayd, The Messenger of God ﷺ cuts his readers a verse in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.If his readers read a verse that says: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, then he stands, then he says: Praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds, then he stands.Then he stands, then he says: The money of the Day of Religion), “Ibn Khazimah, and the ruler with the words:” (The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, is upon him The Most Merciful, the verse of the praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds, two, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, three verses, the money of the Day of Religion is four verses, and he said: This is how we are Fifth of his shock), “And the Darqni is with the words:” (He used to read: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the praise of God, the Lord of the world, to the last of it, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the last And he returned: in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.He greeted the Quran, and some of it was mentioned on the way of the representatives, and you did not get tired, and there is only an evidence that it is a verse, and it is a Muslim, and it is a Muslim, and it is a Muslim, and it is a Muslim, It is from the conqueror, not, and so in the third novel, that he, may God bless him and grant him peace, was reading it in prayer, and he promised it a verse of his righteousness The first of the Qur’an, and the second verse of it, praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds, and so to the fifth, and the Sabbath collected, and the words were cut off, and the narration is the lord of the ritual, so there is no The name is a verse from the conqueror, as it is possible that the meaning is: may God’s prayers and peace be upon him and peace be upon him.Hope: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the Praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds, to the last, that is, the verses that were cut off by a verse, and some of them were connected to one, and the enemy, and the enemy, In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful The prostration of the slave was attributed to those who left it, and may God’s prayers and peace be upon him removed, so he thought that it was not from the Qur’an to recover it in the parents of the messengers, Those who have been blessed with them and did not stand on it, but arrived May God’s prayers and peace be upon him, for the time of the pharaoh, and the time of the imagination of something that contradicts its time, but there is nothing to feel it, so that it is the one who feels, so that it is the one who feels, then the The approach of paragraphs, something desired in it, and the integrity of the seizures does not harm, so where is the muffles of the conquest, so the patronage is necessary, and it is not necessary.And the adjective in another verse preceded by the example, and preceded the proverbs, and whoever blesses God Almighty, and defined those who have been blessed with them, and he was completely and fully The concept is not angry with an incomplete words, and on this, it was not proven in this (P-43) narration except that the name is a verse of the Qur’an, and it is a Muslim, and it is a Muslim, and it is a Muslim, and it is a Muslim, From the Fatah, it is the abandonment of the murder.As for what he mentioned in the second pilgrimage from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, it was brought up by Al -Tabrani and Ibn Merdawi, and Al -Bayaki with the words: God, the Most Merciful, is the one who is the second and the great Qur’an, and it is the mother of the Qur’an, and it is the openness of the book), and the Darqni brought it out.Read: In the name of God, the Most Merciful, it is the mother of the Qur’an, the mother of the book, and the second seven, and in the name of God, the Most Merciful, one of its verses) The two worlds to the last verses are seven verses, and with it the Hanafis said, and when God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, observed the delusion Salafa, as it is not a verse of the Qur’an, removed this delusion with the face of a gone, and he said: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, one of them, that is, the same, that is The Qur’an, and the meaning of the second: If you want to read the praise to the last of what it follows, then read before it in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.The second, and this is the same as the illusion, or the desire, with the rule of praise for God, the Lord of the worlds, to the last, and his saying: And in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful is one of themselves The first narration, which is like an illusion, or the desire also in the readings of the name, and what we mentioned, and if it is in it, the commitment of a metaphor, but he called us to conduct the ritual This is done on his backs, so there must be the obligation of the metaphor in the chest as it is not hidden, and it is the adherence of the disagreement of the original before the need for it, and what he mentioned in the Hajj, so it is not possible That the name is from the Qur’an as it is acknowledged it, and we are from whom we violate it, and as for what he mentioned in the four, the first hadith, the second, the third, the one, the one, and the one who is not It is indicated by the intended, and we say what it indicates, and the lifted Mouqouf on Ibn Abbas, and we do not surrender that his ruling is to raise the pharaoh of the guidance, and if we say that the correctness is that the verse is known to be a lord of the shed For example, and for that enemy “pain” where they were located, and they did not count.The Qur’an, strived and made it a sign of the conqueror, or we say: He also said that from a loyalty, but he thinks that he is in his belief, and he is a loyalty, and the fifth With this memorization, and perhaps with the memorial that the Darqatni brought him out, and he had a predecessor with his reports, and I have no way for me to do the utterance, and for the sake of the hadeeth, In the sense, it is changed, and I have no interpretation to see it, for the transfer of it, and the seven does not reveal the words of the words of the Messenger of God, and the Messenger of God, and the Messenger of God, So he shouted, and he is the most correct of those who have been given to the opposite, but whoever was the hadiths, he was rewarded with this, and for my life, if it was correct, I would not be satisfied with it.I showed them, and his night mentioned his chain of transmission to see him, and the fifth argument is in it, so we do not surrender that its duty is at the beginning of Al -Fatiha This place is with his saying: Read in the name of your Lord, and very much of the faces that appear from the sun, so we do not tire Lebanon with its two ways.As the name of the Qur’an, but it is from the conqueror, so it is not presented, and the exhaustion of its colors is presented as a Qur’an to speak in this evidence, which is not satisfied with the ritual The straight, fairness is the half of the religion, and the purpose of the truth is from the ethics of the believers, and the seven argument is that we do not have as it is not hidden, and the eighth is the eighth Its orbit - and it is the tire of the words of our children, Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him - a head of heads, and the ninth pilgrimage is like the fifth pilgrimage to the sake With his saying: (Every matter is a matter of mind), etc., it is not something, because the conqueror is part of the open prayer with the proud of the comparison to the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one She opened the name, but it was overlooked, and it was invalidated, and so is the kneeling and the prostration that is close to what the servant is in it to his Lord, each of them is a matter With the name, it was void, and the good thought of the religion of science and his knowledge was that he was the first (P-44) of his prayers, and with his knees, his souls, his souls, his souls, and his soul, God is upon him, and the argument is the most beautiful, and it is not based on us because we have known you with our gold, and the sharp argument is the same Ma’awadah when he did not read the name and left The duty and did not prostrate to the least, he repeated the prayer to sore a peace from the cell, and this is his pledge until he emptied to see what he was forced to do so.By leaving and obligatory, it is forced with prostration, not to be exaggerated by their symptoms in that prayer, too, with a blessing, when the Shafi’i narrated it, as it is the same as the soul, as it is the same as the soul.Mu'taziya to the city, so he prayed with them, and he did not read the name of God, the Most Merciful And the supporters: O Mu’awiya, you stole from the prayer, where is the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Then he repeated the prayer with the name, and the arrogance, and this does not harm us, yes, the flower remains, and the search for it is hidden now, and the second pilgrim is the same The garment is not obligatory for his saying that his saying is that the elders start with the hurricanes with the hopes of goodness with the remembrance of God That is, etc., and he was inferred from the garment on him, as they were upon them, peace be upon them, with his words, the Almighty: Those who are the guidance of God, and I will be guided by God It is ignorant of interpretation, and the number of briefing on the news of the vow, and the third pilgrimage is ten, do not find it a benefit in our metaphor, and also in our interview The remaining arguments are many of the past, do not benefit in the research with us except with the arrival of the Qatas A Muslim and others from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him My servant is two descriptions, and my servant is what he asked, so if the servant said: Praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds.The Day of Religion, God Almighty said: My servant is glorified, and if he said: We do not worship and you seek help.The righteous is the path of those who have been blessed with them, other than those who are angry with them or the lost.Al -Fatihah, and that it is seven with her, where he made the mediator to you, and you will seek help and the three before it to God Almighty, and the three of them are for the sake of the servant, The Qur’an, and there is no doubt that this narration is more correct than the narration of Al -Thalabi, and I do not present a fox over a Muslim, as well as from the narration of Sajasini, and when he is the one who is From it with a zoom or a deficiency of its conversation An anomaly, and this is not from the chapter of negation and the confirmation as it is what he does not have in this art, and there is no steadfastness, and the description is carried in it on the half in the meaning or the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the meaning of the He needed him, nor a village on him, and made him a truth, but by administering the supplication and praise, the enemy and the saying lie to him The majesty of the man does not hear nor enrichs hunger, because the document is many, and the wound is validated by the hostility, not the divorced, but if it is not a lot, but if it is not There are many here, and the time of division is for the conqueror and the name is shared with it with the unlike of the appearance, and the ruling is not required, as it is the righteousness, as it is the one who is the ruling, as it is the one who is the ruling, as it is the one.And if the one who wants to do the prayer, as the phenomenon cannot be intended for the stomachs of the work, and the widow of the surah, and the some achieve that some of the people, if it is not, is that it is not.Some are resigned with a principle, a cut, and the second is supplied, and the first is on our saying, and also Al -Fatihah Surah is like a lot and the king, and the Lord of God is upon him It was narrated by Abu Hurairah from him by the fact that the first is three verses, (P-45) and the second are thirty, and they stopped them on it, and it was not the same, and if it is a long time, it is not an arrest He did not want, and on the two stabilizers, and that he is, he returns to the second, his commitment to control the pretext of the imitation of the conqueror, and the one who is in the way, and the one who is in the way, It is not far, and praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds, a verse, and the part of another verse, as in the end of their calls, the verse, after a void measuality of the opposite There, and his optimism here, and too, the many brightness of the light without a nickname, then it was then included after, and the hadith of the correctness in the beginning of the revelation will show the right It is a verse of the surah or the part of a verse, and it was not descended after the second is excluded if the first is not excluded, and the hadith is that it is the first of what we have come to.The constant, and it is formed by what was narrated that he was writing: in your name, O God, etc.As the name is a part of a surah of innocence, as it is not hidden from those who have been delivered to him and his emotions, it is a verse of the Qur’an, and he does not He stands in its Qur’an, or deny the rituals of its readers, and says with its teeth, then God, if it is full to me, the earth is gone, and I do not go to this.And the grace of God Almighty - his success, how and the books of the hadiths are full of what is indicated by his success, and he is the one who was authenticated by me from the imam, and the saying is that it is not.And how it does not provide for the last age in the same way This is the dangerous matter that is the one who is the command of the prayer from its health or its continuation, and it can be entrusted with some of the lawful rulings, and the affairs of the religions, and the rituals of the people The great imam, and the diligent, the old, may God be pleased with him, and concealing it in the wiping.God Almighty, peace and blessings be upon him, so that Ibn Abbas: “(The Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, did not publicize, and peace be upon him until he died),” and he narrated.The Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and my father, Bakr, Umar, and Utman, and I did not hear one of them.To hide with the evidence of what was said about it, they were not the most prominent of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.With his chain of transmission: “(The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was pleased with the name of God, the Most Merciful It was narrated on the authority of Abdullah ibn al -Mughafil, and we do not receive his weakness that he said: “My father heard me and I say: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and he said: I prayed the successor of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and the successor of Abi Bakr, and Omar, and Uthaman, so they started reading with the praise of God, the Lord of the Lord, then: Praise be to God, the Lord of the two worlds, “That is, make it more than it, and he is the most lum Al -Husayn, Al -Sha’abi, Al -Nakhdi, Qatdah, Umar ibn Abd al -Aziz, Al -Alamash, Al -Zahri, Mujahid, and Hamad, and others, and they are a great creation, The hadith of Ibn Abbas, who was brought up by Al-Shafi’i from him: “(The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him (P-46), was in the name of God He was submitted to him, or a person who was on the authority that he was sometimes a phenomenon for it to be read in it as the age of Omar, may God be pleased with him, was read by God.With the pride of the flags, and until he died, there is a restriction for the exile, not for the negation, so they do not contradict, on the authority of some of the exiles, and in the noble in the hadith, in the hadith, in the hadith, and it is not in the hadith in the hadith, and it is not the same An article, and about my hearts that he classified a book in the wickedness, so some money was divided upon him, so that the authenticity will be known to him, and he said: It was not correct in the hadith, On the authority of one who is bound by one, who is narrated by the deceased and the most hidden, for fear of the sons of the illiterate of those who disagree God has honored the Almighty, as the wickedness of the wickedness does not harm us, as it is presented when the strongest is a chain of transmission, and it is what we agree with us, as it is on the condition of the one who is the condition Lies to my people, who are I who have the concern of the companion of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him His companions.* * * (And from the wonders of Al -Razi) how to show the accusation of the accusation, and the symptoms of the people of the city are narrated on the master of the Malak of the children of the mother of that of the righteous, the good, Fear, silence, and wonder, and the most arrogant than this is that he mentioned six arguments to prove the wickedness is more hidden from the nomadic, (the first) that the name is from the surah, and it is the authority of it.And the one is confidential, some are a jurisprudence, and it is returned by what you taught in the Raddouds, and by the exposure of it, it is from the surah, that is, what is forbidden from the bit, And the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, did it, “Follow him” and perhaps the secret in it is like the secret in the wickedness and the concealment in the rak'ahs of one prayer, or it is said: The Qur’an was a first cell, and a second generosity, as it is his condition, but if you contemplate his words, the Almighty in the hadith that is fixed when the people of God: Etc., a great secret of you appeared to you, so may God bless you from the diligence, (the second) is that it is praise and greatness, so it is obligatory to declare it for it to say: Your male your fathers or more remembrance and rejects it is that the majority of the consequences of the prayer, as well as the most prominent of it.(Third) The wickedness of the remembrance of God indicates the inspiration with it, and the extent of the indifference of its denial, and it is an improved mind, so it is like that He said: This is a powerful argument in myself, is established in my mind.The ophthalmology is not with a disgraceful person, with a majesty of the destiny of the destiny.So he hides it, or good, and he will make it out of it, and I do not think that the man is only good, for the pilgrim is strong in himself Al -Shafi’i on the authority of Anas that Muawiyah prayed to the people of the city, and he did not read in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.And his opponents respond to him, or it is said: He was not read on his appearance, and they knew that with some readers and what he listened to.(Fifth) What Al -Bayahqi narrated from Abu Hurairah: “(The Messenger of God was a public in prayer in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful Abbas, and Ibn Al -Zubayr, as for Ali, he has been frequent from him, and whoever is hidden in his debt with me, he has lost, and the opponent responds to him and the opposite of the one who said: For the sake of the news, in the news that we mentioned, what also opposes his attribution to Omar, Ali and Ibn Abbas, and what has been beneficial for his attribution to Ali is the one of the people, Yes, the Shiites claimed, so they went to the wicked in the secret and the flower, and if one of the work of all what they claim (P-47) did his frequency from the emir, but the faith is not.And the infidelity is one, and what he mentioned is that whoever is hidden in his debt is upon me, so he was a Muslim, but if he greeted us, he would have told him what he had to do with him.It is carried out that the wage is for the Sunnis of the Sunnah, the sheikhs must be presented, and if they are disagreed, then what the friend has, where the Prophet is in the authority of the Prophet (My companions are like the stars, with any of them, you are guided by you), and secondly: ((Ali with my Sunnah, and the Sunnah of the Creator, the Rashids, the Mahdi, the one who is in me), Father Bakr and Umar), “And he was upset:” (If you do not find me, then you will come to Abu Bakr).(Sixth) that it is attached to an inner act that is like: with insulting the name of God, they are seemed, and there is no doubt that the wondering of this word is the one who does not God is only with the grace of God, and there is no power on the obedience of God except by the success of God, and his alert is that he does not have anything from the good, unless it is a matter An order with a well -known, and he returns it with the ride of this estimation and a number of saying that the understanding of the matter with the known from this sentence needs a thought, for the sake of the His Almighty saying: We do not worship you, and we seek to get weak, weakening it without a lot It is only beneficial in the multiplication of blackness and the weakness of the students with the mud of the supply.(The third research is in its costume), so it is either: for use, or accompanying, or adhesion, or the sequel, or increased, or division, and the fourth of the brother I seek to see some of the verses, and it is more likely to be more likely from the first, for the one who feels the words of the good, the first of the first, and the one who is the first He feels that he has an increase in an income in the verb, as if he does not come and there is no obedience to the name of God Almighty, and they do not give up a kind, and what is indicated by the words The second, and it was supported by the fact that the accompaniment is more in the seedlings of the use of use, not in the suffering, and what is made of its course of the verbs, and that the blessing is in the name of God And the greatness of it, With the disagreement of making it for the family, it is a slander that is not intended in the same way.That is, and that if the Ba is carrying the accompanying, it was evidenced by all the actual parts of the act of God Almighty if it was made inside the machine, and it is not in the authority of the machine (The name of God Almighty in the heart of every Muslim is called or not called), and that the blessing is in the name of God, the Almighty, a phenomenon that is understood by every one, The reminder in his place is a family that is not affected only by a precise look, and if the name of God is the Head of the Hemorrhoids of the verb, it is not only with it that it is not.He returned with the hereafter to the meaning of blessing, so let us say it first, and if he made his name to the height of the lord of the Fatih al -Fatihah, it does not come to the one who says: He said, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: “In the name of God, who does not harm anything with his name),“ From what he is forgotten by him, and in the first one, and the first person, and the first person, In the name of God, it is supplied in the readers, then if you are made for the use of the path, the path of the pen was made, then it is not a reader, and it is a reader, and if it is in it, and it is in it.By reducing the memorial to the multiplication of the meaning to estimate: it is left, and it is for his formation immediately, in which there is the form of the verb, and it has been proven that it is not necessary for each God is up to his help, the same as his affairs, so the situation was referred to an increase, and when the use is first, it is almost to be a certainty, as it has the literature and the literature of the literature It is not in the pretext of accompanying, and because there is a prayer from the first and the first to the overthrow of the state and the power, and the denial of the resignation of the destiny of worship, and its influence, which is the conquest of the poverty, With a treasure, there is no power or power except with God, and because this meaning is based on his words, the Almighty: and you are helping, and because it is like the one who says: For his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: The proof of the majority is the maturity of the murder, (as for the second), because it is a delusion that arose from their representatives in the machine with the sensors, and all of them are not in the way Sahih I sought help from God, and he was returned on the legs.Another side, and also in the specialization of the use of the family, because it may be with it, and in the capacity, and if it is a ladder, then what is the prohibition of the reference to it, as it is that it is that it is that it is not.With the same, it is The intended is the present, as there is no power or power except with it.(As for the third), it is that the partners are used to the gods of their gods, close, as they are their mediators in the approach to it, and it is more likely to be a family.(As for the lord), because the machine is inevitable in every part to the last verb, otherwise it is not fulfilled, and we do not recognize the obligation between the affairs of anything For all its parts, and what he mentioned from the hadith, it is the use of it.As for the heads that were held by the heart of every Muslim who is called or was not named.(As for the fifth), because if he wanted that the meaning of the accompanying blessing, the heroes appeared, and he returned with a hidden one, and if he wanted to understand it, then he would understand it, then he would understand it.With it, if the verse is intended to stop the legitimacy on it, and as for the blessing of the blessing, it is an apparent meaning of each one, so we do not accept that it is from the one who is the one) Because the blockade has a variety, and the swallow is because the thing is opened by the thing, there is no prevention from it as part, so the conquest is the openness of the Qur’an, So he made her openness to the lineage to what he prepared.(As for the eighth), because the meaning of the hadith: I do so, seeking help from the name of God, who does not harm me with the remembrance of his name, seeking him with something, for what is for him, for the sake of it.His door kept it, and it was preserved, and if I followed this, and I repeated what was said in the response that what is meant by the hadith is that it does not harm with the remembrance of the name of the name A matter with her, we have: And her is a news of the exile of the companions of the circle, the companions of the benefit and the blessing are understood, and it is the motivation of the chaos from the reader with the reward of the reward, so there is no Imported people, and it does not mutilate us, as we have not forgotten it with a lot, (as for the ninth), because he made the supply like the one who is the one who is the one who is on the one And the joke is that the name of God likened the name of the believer to what was returned from the Sunnah and the cutting with its necessity with the command, and it is the same, and it is the same, and it is the same It brings out the exaggeration of the metaphor for its fall into the letters.(As for the tenth), because he does not hide the state of similarity to the pen, (and the one is ten), because we do not surrender that the blessing is the meaning of accompanying, or it is necessary, but it is from it.Outstanding, that accompanied by his name is his grace, there is with it, and he is under the use of his name, glory to him, that he can seek from what is not.It is hidden, and it can be after the selection of the zammari, for it to get the struggles of the intense Satan And he will come if God wills his response, and he has been disagreed with the attachment of the neighbor, so the Imam went to Ibn Jarir to his estimation: Atto, because his following is the same Every act is a verb, which makes the name a principle for him, and it is one of the Qur’anic suffering, as his organizers for her misfortune in the definition of the tongue, and with it, and the words The intended here is a special speaker, so it is a limit, and if you see, all of the guarantee intends for himself Its existence, and the saying comes with its part of all or part, without hidden, and when it is hidden from that, he made the one who did the one who did not He said the charitable and the estimated, and the choice of the deceased is about a choice, and it was narrated from Ibn Abbas because it is the Almighty (P-49) of the name in order to search for the servants of the servants, To teach, and the grammarians went to its generalization in general, we are: start and supported by its face The action of the readers, and the estimation of the public, the first, that you do not see them appreciate the attachment of the incident neighbor, or a row, or a case, or a link, in the universe and the stability of it, The public is valid.(And from it) that it is resigned by the abuse of the name, and it is its initiative, so it is possible to fall into the lapha It is also in the vicinity of it, and the name is not in it, in which it is in it, and the appearance of the verb is the one who says, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: In it in the name of God, it is the most severe), “As for the appearance of the readers in his saying, the Almighty is: Read in the name of your Lord The verb, and not so in the name.And what the Imam is gone to, a mother, and the one who is intended, and it is a result of which, it requires that the readers are located in its costs, a chair of the name of the name, the name of the name of the name Qaddad: start, as you do not offer him to that, and what was mentioned first of the consultation by the ability of the grammarians and the restriction, so it is not for them, so it is not good, so it is not good, so it is not good, so it is not good.Where they do not mean a worker with his eyes, but they want to speak on the worker from where he is, so they are their representatives with good, and Omar, not for the sake of the word An example, so he will be close to understanding, and it is not said if the actor is inspired by them that they are not able to do so that it is not a blessings of the reader, because what is meant by him is the one The reading of its sincerity on the first readings, the middle, and the last, and the one who is the first of the first.And the preacher of the general infection, by adopting that it is a house that is obligatory, but it is known to the revelation of the place that the beginning of it is the reader, or the one who does not have the same So it is its corruption, so if the shrine indicates his will, then what is meaning that it is revealed by the house of the obligatory, then, and it is that it is the reason for the word, the one who is not the same, the question is not.What was mentioned secondly) that the reaction of the act of performance is based on the extent of the extent, and it is not a Muslim, and we have provided that the reader is the most important and the most comprehensive, and the ritual in the beginning is not in the beginning.The appetite, when he started with the poison, the intended for him is not limited to something, as he prayed and started with the pride of the forbidden, he does not need to be needed, and he does not need to be in.It is limited to its blessing and its inclusion for all of what he did, and from this he appears in what is in the rest of the words from the weakness, (and what is mentioned third), then he is that the time of the name By doing, not by adding the verb, and the hadith did not want that every matter that is not said, or he was never guaranteed in it in the name of God, so it is like that The hadeeth is only appropriate to make a joke in the words of the two classes, and whoever is overwhelmed in their behavior, not in the words of God Researcher is in the way of the generalization of the general verb, as I start or start, and what they did not have not in the prevalence of the privacy I read, I mean the verb of the source of the rule Start, I mean the source of the mud, so it is mentioned by the laws of literature and the position of the conflict.And some went to the estimation: my predecessor, for example, and in it the increase in addition, for the duty of the news of the news at that time, then the host will be three words, and the consequences of the ritual Displaced by the one who is harmed by the appealing of the place, except that the violation between the two sentences remains the name and the pharmacist, and the matter, and the matter, The older sheikh is sanctified by this neighbor, a destructive, guaranteed news, it is the beginning of the world, and its appearance, because the provision of the divine names, and it is the authority of the god Related to what is after him, as God does not exalt only with his names as a matter of signal, so he does not look at it to the back, and it is not feared with the rituals, and I do not see the rituals, Many until the consequences of the comment here are delayed, because the name of God is submitted to the verb himself, so let him be presented to the verb (P-50), and to the verb, and to the verb (P-50), and the reference to it.Al -Lami, which is an honorable of the proof is now.I saw something unless I saw God before him, and you will be the same as the same as the sweetness The blessing of the blessing is a combination of importance, and if we say that in the adherence to cut off the throat of the khka, we are in response In the first verse that came down, as the shrine is then the denomination of a prophecy, and there is no response, and there is no way in it, and for every place of an article, and the rhetoric: the custodian of the words, for the sake of the case, The shortage is brought to him to think of the remembrance of the seal, until some of them claimed it with its three types, and the bit of one was lost, so it was confined to the palace, And in the heart, and in the heart of everything, and here it is appreciated by the largest, and the most said, and the most recently is delayed from the yard of the investigation, for the sake of the investigator B is, or after a name, or after the name of God, or after the distance, either it is estimated after the B.It does not say it to those who know the b.As for after the name, it would be chapter, and if it is reasonable, where they answered the deletion here between the two of the two, but after the name of God, then the name of God is the name of God Between the adjective and the descriptions, and between the two gravity, it expands the abundance, and after the completion, it appears a minimal shortage, because in the sentence of the ritual With the high, the Most Merciful was a cause for the restricted rule in the name of God, then if the rented worker is delayed, and it is done, and it is done, and it is done.Its face appears, and if we appreciate the worker, it is presented as it is the basis of the warning, and it will get a choice as well, as it was said, for example: I read it, or the one The Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, and the abandonment of the cause, the remedy of the rhetorical position is required, if the cause of the other appears, there is no other cause, then it is not the same When he said with the understanding of the adjective, so he feels that those who did not describe this outside of the circle, and the restriction here is not like the time, and there is no one.Pupping: seeking in the name of God, because the Most Merciful is the Most Merciful, I read in it what is not hidden from the ritual ritual, and in the urbanization of the juvenile, and it is a reason, and it is permissible, Something in the phenomenon, which is transmitted, except for the old name, a hidden symbol to the accusative of the constant in the knowledge, and if it is not on the authority of God, the exalted of God, for God, for the exalted The divorced woman, and the appearance of something like it, and everything is like it except its face, and the indication is that there is no harm in that, it is committed, and the blessing is like the obligatory.Fracture, not guaranteed, and here is as you see, and from the oldest who said: I have not seen anything except and I saw God In it, there is no solution, and the most complete is more than the first, and the rituals are four, and the mercy of the mercy is sung for every dirham, and the sins of the thorns of the soul, The worker is a delayed, he saw in the name of God, its might, “(And in your name, my Lord, I put my side), and their likes are, so they passed through it, and the difference is a back of the day So he woke up to him, and he slept from him.And the definition is stable at some, and a linguist at one another, and it has been violated in their interpretation, so it was said: The prostitution is what is its worker, and the one who is unknown, His work is deleted, divorced, and it was said: The stable is what his worker is general, such as crops, and the stability, and it is estimated, and the language of its differences, and it is said: the absence On the other hand, it is not understood from it, whether it is mentioned or not, and the stable is what it understood from the meaning of his powerful factor that is from the general verbs, and all of you In it, the choice of the first, so the custody is here, so that the worker was estimated, but the Baa and the right of the virtuous are broken to be open to the one who opened it, and it is open to the one who opened it.To his heavily, and his being is an interview for the good Arabs, the silence of its hidden, and its enemy, but it is from where it is the words of the words of it.With the poor, an excuse or an insulting, the right of the conquest, as it is the brother of the tranquility in the subtle light in the many ways to the elderly of the people of the time The letter, and the run, and each of them is appropriate for the fracture.Not in the forefathers except rare, it is appropriate for the numbers, and the neighbor, for the argument of the movement of the impact of the impact, and we do not undermine the waves of kindness to the perfection, nor the custody of the ritual For the reward, because the group caused the hunting, and it was not found in every, but the abuse is met, or the division and its waters, and it is obligatory that its work is in the wildness of the wise, in the wise.As if the neighbor is not a trace of them, and this is a grammar, and it is a result after the occurrence of an occasion, so you do not carry a discussion of the weakening of the time The one who loves and its covenant ∗∗∗ is a weakening of the pilgrimage, so we do not purify the eyelids of the thought in it and on it, and some of them said in the regard of the sign: To connect to God Almighty and to comment on his names by breaking the garden, subjugation and humiliation of the servants, so it is not connected to the types of types of knowledge, and the kindness of the knowledge, As he referred to that, Master Omar Bin Al -Fawad, God sanctified the excessive secret of his saying: “If you were from the point of the Baa, he was not lost to me As you see that you do not see what you have prepared ∗∗∗ And that the one who was numerous is the same, for the lifting of the lifting, so whoever reduces the view of the humiliation of the servants, raised by al -Qadir to the viewer of the glory of this Raise with a trick, but it is in the manifestation of the generous divine, and whoever descends to raise, then it is revealed, and he pursued it.It is a matter specialized in the bonds, and it cannot be running in the Bi -Jarat divorced, as it is not hidden, and when I am in the secret of that, the B is the ritual of the second to the second.The stable and the ritual of the paths, it is a reference to the right to the right, and the W.Either indicate its attributes that the point of the colors appeared, and that is what was said to the universal point Al -Shibli: You are the young?He said: I am the point under the B is, and the older Sheikh said: ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ The ugliest slave that we mixed ∗∗∗ that is the tap of the right of the truth, so they were considered ؎ ؎ ؎ ؎ For the precedent, as the hadith indicates to him: “(My mercy is angry),“ The epidemic of the run is a sign of it, because it is the mediator in the addition, and the overflow, so it is the right.Let the matter be completed and the secret appears, and in its appeal about it, it is a miracle of the badness, and the symbol of the fact that the path is the mercy as he said ﷺ: “(He will not enter one of you.You, O Messenger of God?With the Most Merciful, as for referring to the Muhammad's truth, and the first appointment referred to him with his saying ﷺ: (The first thing that God created is the light You got the opposite, as it refers to it: for your loyalty, I did not create the orbits, and to be the predominance of it, peace and blessings be upon him.His Excellency said: We have not sent you only a mercy to the two worlds and his words are up to the believers: The believers are the most merciful of the people of the fracture, and when it indicates it, and it is not the same A symbolism to the adjective of those who were revealed to the book and the call to God, and in that with the description of the ritual of the pray Also, his affair was in his description, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, with this in the Qur’an until he said his grace: You are a great creation, and he is not satisfied with our mind.After, and the first absurdity is a drop, then it is crushed, and there is no surah unless it opened it (P-52), the Lord with the symbolism until the state of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, For those who have heard while he is a martyr, and when the majesty was in Surah, it is an outrageous, he left the sign with the name, and it came with a dirty pattern to change the situation, and the relaxation His grace and the symbolism are left with the collection to the Muhammad's truth, and the disclosure is not more than this in this section, as it is a fear of the hearts of the veil, Hands up to both ways.And the name is the Basris of the ten names that were built on the silence, which is: a son, a son, a son, a name, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, a two, and a two, and two, And the faith of God, and the faith of God from him, otherwise it is one tenth if it is accustomed to a sons, then if they are pronounced with it, they will be a prodigy of the ugliness of the people, and it is the same It is obeyed, and the matter is a sacrifice, which is what he has deleted, as well, and what is the last of the last three of what was presented.And the origin of it is a poison, the waw was relieved of a lot of the recovery, and for the punishment of the movements, the coffee of the cinema and the heat of the mim, and the heart of the mouth of the waters And he scrub it to the names, the name and the name of the scents and the name, and I called it to testify to it, and the wound with the heart is not accepted, and its detection is from the heavens, as it is the heavens, as it is On his name, he is raised from the hidden menstruation to the atom of the back and evacuation.The Kufic said: It is from the characteristic, because it is a mark on his name, and the origin of a name is, so the waw was deleted and the ghost of the prayer was removed from it Come on, and he responds to them that the hampered did not guide within what was omitted, and the increase in the shame is eager than the counterpart of the counterpart, and it is also like it is like it.Exclusively for itself and the connection of it, as it is an exclusive, and the modes are like the part of the origin without the connection.Rather, the waw turned a gossip as a lion and a scarf, and then he used it, so his thym was made, a gossip, and a stroke, and the harm was cut off, And in it there are languages ​​that some reach to the twenty -year A smile like this is a sky with a period of this first, and it was prolonged that the name is the name of the name or other than it?The poets are on the first, and the one who is dismissed on the second, and the sacrifice of the virtues in the liberation of the search is on the face The pride in the great interpretation: This search is running the course of the messenger, and he mentioned a face that he claimed to be his kindness and his jurisprudence, and the shroud of the meteor has been inspired by his response, Explanation of the positions, and he did not fulfill it, and for the Sahili in that words that he claimed to be the right (P-53) and classified In his narration, Ibn Al -Sayyid is a message, and Al -Shihab claimed that he has not yet been released, and that he did not see with the capacity of his knowledge in this question, and there is no one in it.The glorious, and God's mercy did not come in his footnotes on the good one by himself with something that displays the forms, and the mind will be comfortable, and I am from the best of God.The absence of what I wish, and there may be what is not found in the projection, and if it is returned, the response of the words of each of them is a single individual who is met with a grave.The core of the core if it is enabled in a century ∗∗∗ It is not possible for the ritual rituals of the cocations [[The author’s words were sealed for the severity of its length]] An angel, but rather from what was descended from the Qur’an on a saying, which is the narrator on the authority of Ali and Ibn Abbas, and Muqdah, and the most of the companions, and from Mujahid that it is a city, Until he was a havo from him, and it was said: I came down with the Mecca when the prayer was obligated, and in the city when the kiss was transmitted, so that he knew that it was in the prayer, and it was in the prayer, and it was in the prayer.Make an angel and some of it is a civilian, and its weakness is not hidden, and the people have been exhausted with the dwelling on its angel with the verse of the stone: and it has come to you from the seventh of you An angel of the text of the scholars and the narration from Ibn Abbas, and it has a good judgment, not because what accepted it and what is far from it in the right It was not in the right of the people of Mecca, the most famous of it, and the powerful is the one who is transmitted from the companions who witnessed the revelation and the download, because this is the same The interpretation of the seventh of the second one, and it is, if it is correct, fixed in the hadiths, but it was also true of Ibn Abbas, and others are interpreted, and it is the same.The one who is given the thing before his giving is with the fact that God Almighty has blessed him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and peace be upon him.A clear opening, and it is before the conquest in two years, and the expression in the past is a realization of the fall, and this is if it is the disagreement of the phenomenon, not with the reference In the exposure of the age, and the majority in it is the precedent of the fall, and the compassion: and do not restrict your eyes to what we enjoyed with the verse, except that the evidence has been scratched, and it is not said: It has come down with Mecca, and on the negation, we will go to the city (P-34) also, not, because we say: the negation is the original, and on the prosecutor of the confirmation, and what is the one who is in the rituals of the The symptoms are that the descent is a back of the unseen world to testimony, and the appearance of it does not accept the repetition, because the appearance of the appearance of the heroes, the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who is the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who is the one who is the one who was the case لِفائِدَةٍ, أوْ It is on a letter again and another for the roses (Malik) and (Malik), or with a peaceful Muslim, and it must be with it, and it is the gathering of the doctrine and the narrators of the sake of the valid.For him, as it is not hidden, and the surah is a matter of fault and other things with a substitute, if it is from the captain, which is the rest, because the rest of everything is from it, and it is from it, and it is from it, and it is from it, The homes or the wall of the city to surround its verses, or from the argument, which is the high and the reinforcement to reiterate it by being the words of God Almighty, and it is called the ritual The saying of the naps: ؎ Do you not see that God gave you a surah that see every king around it, so that a Quran that is covered by a light and a rhetoric, and a seed, is a sect.To come out of the verse of the Karsi, a transgression, and the names of the whole have been established with the hadiths and the antiquities, so whoever says that it is said: a surah, so that it is like that On what was narrated from Anas and Ibn Omar from the forbidden from that, it is not accustomed to it, as the hadith of Anas is weak or a picker, and the hadith of Ibn Umar, and the one who is a son, Correctional, and Al -Fatihah in the original is a row that was made either for the first thing, because it is a median in the openness of all, and the transmission of the transmission, or the exaggeration, or the sake of it.A source that was called the first to be called the source of the source, a notice of his argument, as if it was the same as the conquest, as it is attached to it, and it is related to it With the group, it is part of it, and so is it said in the conclusion, because the last of the last is exposed to the last, and all by its midst, and it is not like this, and it is not like this.However, he is more than his being for the family, or a while, because this is an inherent and comparative act, and the majority is that the machine is not described, and it is not compared to the one, and it is not compared to the one, and it is not compared to it An occasion for the illusion that some be uninterrupted, and they are permissible to be for the lineage, that is, the same conquest, with the faces of the most desirable, and the book (and the book) And the conquest of the conquest of the measure to it, not to the destiny between it and between its parts, and it is achieved in the science, the lamp, or the house of the pride, so it is not in the righteousness of the ritual in the sake of this The first, and the first addition from the addition of the name to the name, which is a famous, and the second in the sense of the mother, as in the part of the thing, not in the sense of (from), as in the absence The sheikh of Islam, which is a matter of some in each, said Ibn Kaysan and Al -Sirafi: The collection of adding the part is in the sense (from) Al -Tabadiyyah, but rather in the luminous, and the sacrifice: Likewise, as well as a difference between part and part, and some of them made the addition in the partial partial, and some of them are in general, and the most beautiful, as well as in general.Example, and made it in The divorced woman is the city of Baghdad, a mother, and the month is unaware.And for this generous surah is the names that some are reached to a nose and ten years, one of which is the opening of the book, because it is its principle on the path of the righteous, not because it is in the time The learning, and in the reading in the prayer, as the imam al -Sayuti claimed it, nor because it was the first surah that came down as it was said, but the first and the third is because the principle is from the principle of You call for the observance of the synchronization in the rest of the parts of the book from your two, and there is no doubt that the learning and the Nazouli are not as well as the second I know (P-35) that what is meant by the book is not true to the one who is read in the prayer until it is considered a name for it, and it is the beginning of it, That is because it is the first surah that was written in the wave, and it needs a transmission, and if it is correct that it is correct the Qur’an, which is in our Qur’an as in the lap, then the ritual The one was written, and the dominance of the suspicion is another matter, (and the second) is the opening of the Qur’an, because we did the example of the calm with the slander, (and the third and its righteousness) (Do not say one of you, the mother of the book, and he says: the opening of the book), “I do not pray for it, but it has been established in the chapter, it is called it, as it is not hidden from the one, and it is not hidden from the The appetite is a book, a recitation, or a descent on a saying or a prayer in it, and after that it is followed, it is like the mother who forms the child after her, and it is said to the mother, and it is also said to the mother: To present it and follow the army for it, and it is the mother of the villages, or to disobey it as the science said on the purposes of the suffering in the Qur’an from the praise of God, and it is the one who is God.With the matter and the forbidden, and from the return, the praise is back, and the worship is from the praise of God because it is for the knowledge, so it is valid for the affairs of the affairs On the authority of the sentence in the sentence, and we do not see it in it, or from the guidance of the straight path, if I want the religion of Islam, or from the estimation of the people, and from the name of God, and from the name of God.Either from you worship, it is a news about his specialization with worship, and it is the fulfillment of the slaves of the arms of what the master commanded or forbidden, and it is forbidden, and it is not permissible, and it is not permissible.He responds to the dismissed, the precedent of the precedent and the origin of the origin, and it is obligatory for us after the numbers of the pronouncement of the first of the servants, and in the righteousness of the servants, and in the righteousness, and in the righteousness To him, not, and may God bless him and grant him peace be upon him They have to be angry with them or from the Day of Religion, that is, the penalty, and the rewarding either what is easy or What is harmful, and they are the reward and punishment, but the intentions were that the messengers are the messengers and the books of the books are mercy to the worshipers, and the guidance of what they reconcile, Whoever is able to communicate the blessings is a finding, and a supply, then the connection to it with what is connected to the bond, and the increased is done by deeds and disturbing, and the communication of what is in it The argument, and the prevention of the stimulus with hearts and bodies, and the praise is a kinship of the one who is with him with the investigator, and the knowledge is entered with the descriptions And the removal and recession between the obedient and the sinner, so faith entered into God Almighty and his attributes, prophecies, and the re -of the boldness, and worship, and the one who can be able to be able to do.It enters into it from the face of faith in the prophecies, and what is related to it from the book, and the angels, as the matter and the end are the providence of that in the sentence, and the one who is the one, And they are sent to worship, and people are like a hundred camels in which there is no place in it, and they are mostly sent by desire and dread, and their mediators are the hope, the righteousness, the goodness, the goodness, the goodness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the ritual, People and the hippo, for three guidance to the interest of pension and repetitions, and I do not confine to you the face of the confusion with this, so the mockery of the mortar, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, So the praise is perpetuated in worship, as there is no judgment for the mind, and perhaps he made him a crop for him, asking that the thanks of the blessing, and the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, And the whiteness did not accept that, so he crossed what he crossed from the article, or to disobey it on the sentence of its suffering from the theory wisdom, and the rulings of the path, the rulings of the path, And the view of the tranquility of the pricing, the homes of the hardships, and the first (P-36) is beneficial from the first surah to its saying: the Day of Religion and the second is from the saying of it: And the righteous paths of the straight path, from its saying: the guidance of the verse, and the view of its saying: You have been blessed with them, etc.With it, preaching, as well as supplication and praise, and this is the sentence of Quranic.The areas of religion, (the first) is the knowledge of the origins, and its contract is the knowledge of God Almighty, and his attributes, and the signal is by saying: the Lord of the two worlds, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.By saying the Almighty: You have been blessed with them and the mummy to him by saying the Almighty: Malik on the Day of Religion.(The second) The knowledge of the vocals, and the worshipers of the worship, which is intended to say it: I do not worship it and it is a minor and financial, and they are separated to the matters of pensioners from the pension The rules, so you are threatened The vocals are on the basis of origins, (the third) is the knowledge of what it has, and it is the knowledge of the ethical, and the sake of the principles to the Samaddian urbanization, and the custodian of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way The high ranks, and the indication of his saying: And we seek help from the straight path (the lord), the knowledge of the stories and the people of the nations, the peace of the peace He communicates with it from the promise and the bastard, and it is what is meant by the Almighty saying: You have been blessed with them other than those who are angry with them or the lost, and if you are more These two sacrifices call for the book of the book on the suffering, or its appreciation in the additional composition, and the first face does not require it and from this, it is like it, and it is not the same Because it is formed on them that it is mentioned that the conqueror adjusts the two thirds of the Qur’an, as it removes it if it proves that the talla does not equal detail, then the increase in its buildings is a place of the buds of the house.From the reward, Al -Shihab said, and then he said: It is surprising that it was said here that this is because of its insults on the connotation of guarantee, and commitment, and they are the third of the connotations, and I say: May God have mercy on him with what Al -Dawli narrated in the Faris on the authority of Abu al -Darada: The Qur’an was made in the other palm, as the book of the book on the Qur’an is seven times, for it is only one of the preferences in the reward, so he will rejoice He promoted him, and on his face, the owner of the gossip does not oppose, yes, that it is distant, and it is possible to separate between the two experts, and with it the forms of the first and the first of the first, and the first of the first, and the first of the first A stone on the wide mercy, or by the fact that the essay is disturbed to disturb the situation, or by that what the whole thing is amended by all of it Prayer, the same in his saying: The Qur’an is the Qur’an.Let it be managed, and on the verbs, it is not measured by what was said in the face of the name with that, because it is the best of the light, or because its prohibition is like the forbidden of the Qur’an, or for the sake of the Qur’an, or for the sake of the Qur’an.Faith is to it, or because it is a judge, and the arbitrators are the mother of the book, and I do not subjugate some of the integrity of the rituals because the face of the name is not obligatory, and it is not necessary for you And peace be upon you, (it is not said): If the conqueror is a gathering because of the suffering of the book, then the seven of it fell from the righteousness of the fruit, the gym, the goodness, the Zayy, the shin, and the shame.That is for the indication that the meanings are not obligated by the Levantine Kin He looked at your pictures, and it was seven in accordance with the number of verse that is intended for many of the secrets, and it was from the shadow of the darkness that was not found in the one who was found in the one who was found in And it is collected after the projection of the deceased: (a path to the right to hold it), which is the Nurani, which is interested in it with its light families to refer to the dominance The release of what indicates the mercy in Al -Fateh, but the remaining seven did not fall from this type, so the Nurani will be cleared to know that the matter is not The losing people, and in the words of the Almighty: the forefathers of my servants that I am the Forgiving, the Most Merciful, and that my torment is the painful torment of a sign and any sign of that to those who hope that the state of the sentence is in.Nuraniya, which is four ten, a masculine (P-37) with its perfection, and the shadowity is mentioned by seven, and if the ones are touched, it will get Nawran And a pure and pure, referring to the two believers ’divisions, so a believer did not like the light of his faith in the injustice And disobedience, so it does not rest its injustice, its light, "(and the adulterer does not adhere to a believer)" The cure of the manifestation of the arrival of the advertisement, the male is the light, referring to the pure believer, and the mourning of the shameful, referring to the believer Handing in: Some of them are unjust to itself, and some of them are confronted, and some of them are preceded by the goodness of the permission of God, that is the great preference.The fourth is ten, and it was not reflected, so the stabilization will be taken and the fall is fixed, or it will be taken seven, taken from this, and this is the pleasure of knowing it, Just a slander, just a sign that the sun is in the eye, and the appearance is in the between, for this is the hijab and the clothes got the clothes, and this is what is erased for the sake of our lords, From what appears to those who are mired from its seas, who are misleading from the water of its secrets.And for us, the knowledge of the good religion in this denomination is a word that is not in investigator, the lowest imam, as he made the causes of this virginity, so that it is the sacrifice, so that it is a good It is indicated by the coffee, and the gym is the first letter from Hell, and the fear is felt by the treasury, and the Zay and the shin are from the exhalation and the righteous, and the okay is denied, and it is denied, And the first shadow in his saying is up to the Almighty: they went into a shadow with three peoples and also indicating a shadow, and fulfillment of the separation, then he said: If they said: There is no letter Male in the name of something that requires a kind of torment, so no It remains for what you mentioned, and we say: The benefit is that he said in the adjective of Hellman: It has seven chapters for each of them a part of a division, then it is a seventh part of it.The forefathers of this surah, which are the first to be given to the torment, alerted it to those who have read this surah, and believed in it, and know its truths, and it became safe, and it became safe, He ended, and he does not hide what is in it, and his answer does not benefit him and does not enrich him, as he said to say: Let the darkening, wow, noun, b, eyes, and the eye, From the humiliation, the noun is from the fire, and the hm is from the domain, the eye is from the torment, the mate is from the guidance, the richness of the Gawashi, the verses are back, and everyone is in the people of the fire, and it is in the ritual in the The projection of that is not a difference in the first place, on the authority of his words, may God have mercy The master, who has become the end of the religion, the pretext of Islam, and the support of his family, and his attribution (P-38) to the Commander of the Faithful, upon the end of God.Romans are coming out of that, and he was not obligated, and he asked me and he answered, so he does not pray for him, and on the ability of peace, then what is permitted by the one who is satisfied with this For the means of what is not hidden from you from the secrets, then understand that, and God Almighty takes care of your guidance.(Fifth, its sixth, and its seven), the treasure, the foolishness, and the sufficient, because of the passage of its detection on the curtains, so it is sufficient and sufficient, or because it is not described in the prayer Others, (eight) is the basis, because it is the origin of the Qur’an and the first surah in it, (and the ninth and its adore, and the only one and the second is twenty and the third is the same).Supplication, the surah of the question, and the surah of the question, to show it on that, as for its disgrace on the praise, it is an appearance, and so on the thank you, for the one who is the best of God.To be asian as the mother of the Qur’an and the mother of the book.As for the third of the third, it is the case of the first, but rather the appearance.The third and the four as it is not hidden, (and the fourth is ten and the fifteenth).We seek help, and the following is the twenty -one, the sixteenth and the twelve eighth) is the tenderness, the healing and the healing, and the authentic hadiths of the righteousness ( Ten) the surah of prayer is because it is a duty or a child in it, and the junction is the gold of some of the Mujahidin, and a narration from the one in the nose, and it is said: (I divided the prayer between me And between Abdi Nasfin), “He wanted the surah, and the linguistic metaphor for the whole relationship and partiality or the obligation is true or a judgment, such as the metaphor in the omission, Because it appears in a lot of expansion, or for its inclinations of the hearts of its destiny, or because it is because it was seen from the suffering of the meaning of the light) The great Qur’an, which is a phenomenon of what we presented, (and the second and ten) are the second seven because it is seven verses with agreement, and we did not see it as a matter of it except “I saw” By that it is an anomalous nine that is not packed with, or an illusion from the one, except that some of them are the same as the name of the name without you The verse does not suit the adultery of the corruption of the light, on the authority of the Surah of victory, what is from this section, and it is praised and passed in every rak'ah and prayer with a kneeling, or the one who is the one who is the one who is the one So the single rak'ah does not want the prayer of the funeral that the bodies are disturbed, and the prayer of the funeral is a supplication, not a right prayer, and it was said: It was described with that Because it has come down two times, or because it is on two divisions of supplication and a blessing, or because it is the same as the servant reads from it a verse that God has praised, with the news of the one who is in the words of God It was said otherwise, and these sayings are based on the second to be from the trinity, and it is necessary to be of praise for the praise of God, or for the praise of God Whoever recites it, and that it is from the second because God Almighty has excluded it for this nation and praise to God for this grace, then the ruling is in the ruling in the righteousness The disagreement of the Zerkshi to be active for the reader, and the most brought up like the migrant if it cut off a mile or a firmness, we breathed from it, and then it is for it, The preservative of the surah is in the interest that he took from the book of God, the transcendent sectarian, and he grew up with what he kept, and the sexes are also if it is fold Under it is one door, with the fact that the universe of the surah is in its miracle and a miracle of the signs of God The Qur’an is the opening of the book in it, so they are more than an angel, but rather from the parents of the Qur’an on a saying, and it is the narrator on the authority of Ali And the most companions, and on the authority of Mujahid that it is a civilian, and it has been separated with that, until it is a matter The kiss was transformed, to know that it is in the prayer as it was, and it was said: some are angel and some are a civilian, and his weakness is not hidden, and he has gone out.People with the recipient of the verse of the stone: and there were seven of the second and the great Qur’an and it is an angel of the text of the scholars and the narration of the sake Marifa, not because what accepted it and what is after it in the right of the people of Mecca as it was said, because it is based on that the angel was not in the right of the people of Mecca, and the one The transmission of the conveyor from the companions who witnessed the revelation and the revelation, because that is the first on the interpretation of the seventh of the second one, and it is the second one, and it is the second one, and it is the second.The hadiths are also true of Ibn Abbas and others, its interpretation of the seven long, and secondly on the abuse of the two who are the one who is the same May God’s prayers and peace be upon him, with matters before his giving to him.Calculation of the rituals, and this, even if it is the disagreement of the phenomenon, is not with the revenue of the mother, and the word (may), and its arrival in the exposure of the verse, and the diligence in it, and the ritual of the ritual Your eyes are restricted to what we enjoyed with the verse, except that the evidence has been scratched, it is not said: This is this and that is not indicated except that it has come down with the authority of it.In the city (P-34), also, because we say: the negation is the original, and the claimant of the confirmation of the evidence and that it is with it, and what they said in the answer to the symptoms is that it is from the world of And the appearance of it does not accept the release, because the appearance of the appearance of the appearance of the heroes, as the argument of the one who claims that it was in every one, or that it is a vagina, or that it is a matter For the flowers (Malik) and (Malik), or with a peace of time, and a bid, and with it, the doctrines and the narratives are corrected for the rituals, and it is not obligatory, as it is not.And it is not important for a dispensing if it is from the captain, which is the rest, because the rest of everything is some of it, and it is his body if it is from the wall To surround her with her verses, or from the arms, which is the high and the reaction to its effects by being the words of God Almighty, and it is called the House of Rifa’i as it is in the words of the saying: That God gave you a surah that you see every king around it, so that a Quran that is covered by a light and a rhetoric, and it was said: a sect is an independent sect, for the sake Against translator, and the names of the whole have been established with the hadith and the archeology, so whoever says in his hatred to be said: a surah is like this, but a surah is mentioned in it, so that it is like that Omar from the forbidding of that, it is not accustomed to it, as the hadith of a weak or a mandate, and the hadith of Ibn Omar is a man who is on the authority of it A description that was made either for the first Something, for his being a mediator in the opening of all, and the transmission, or the exaggeration, and I do not take it with a lamb or a source that was released to the first With the source, a notice of its salts, as if it was the same as the conquest, as he attached it to it first, then by its midst, it is attached to the group, and it is for the whole, and it is the same.For the last of the other, he offers the last first, and all by its midst, and this is not like the first to do a few effective in the sources, except that it is first of his eyes, or for the first This is an inherent and compared to it, and the majority is that the machine does not describe, and the motive is not compared, that the machine is here, it is not appropriate for the illusion that the bit What is the extent, and they are distinguished to be for the lineage, that is, the same opening, with the faces of the other, the most desperate, (and the book) is the group of the person, and the conquest of the light is not The perpetrator between him and his parts, and he is achieved in knowledge, inspiration, or the home of pride, so there is no harm in the wall of the surah in this name in the first, and the addition of the name, and the addition of the name, and the addition of It is a famous, and the second is in the sense of the mother, as in the part of the thing, not in the sense (from), as in the conclusion of a silver, because the added is a part of the sheikh of Islam.Ibn Kaysan and Al -Serafi: The collection of the addition of the part in the sense (from) Al -Tabadiyyah, but rather in the luminous and its explanation: from the estimated in the addition, it is divorced from the same Part and part, and some of them made the addition in the partial partial, and some of them were in general, and the privileged specials are as in the example, and made it in the same way.Baghdad, Lami and the month does not help him.And for this generous surah is the names that some are reached to a nose and ten years, one of which is the opening of the book, because it is its principle on the path of the righteous, not because it is in the time The learning, and in the reading in the prayer, as the imam al -Sayuti claimed it, nor because it was the first surah that came down as it was said, but the first and the third is because the principle is from the principle of You call for the observance of the synchronization in the rest of the parts of the book from your two, and there is no doubt that the learning and the Nazouli are not as well as the second I know (P-35) that what is meant by the book is not true to the one who is read in the prayer until it is considered a name for it, and it is the beginning of it, That is because it is the first surah that was written in the wave, and it needs a transmission, and if it is correct that it is correct the Qur’an, which is in our Qur’an as in the lap, then the ritual The one was written, and the dominance of the suspicion is another matter, (second), the opening of the Qur’an, when we did the example The book and the mother of the Qur’an, and the hadith: “(Do not say your mother’s mother, and let him say: the opening of the book),“ I do not pray for it, but it has been established in the chapter, as it is called it, so it is not hidden from it.The follower, and it was called for that because the appetite is a writer, a recitation, or a descent on a saying or a prayer for it, and after that it is followed, then it is like the mother, who is the mother, who is the mother, It is also said to Al -Raya: a mother, to preserve her and follow the army for her, and from him the mother of villages, or to disobey her as the science said on the purpose of the suffering of the Qur’an, which is in the Qur’an, who is in the Qur’an, who is in the Qur’an, who is in the Qur’an, who is in the Qur’an.He is his family, and from worshiping the matter and forbidding, and from the return, as for praise, it is an outrageous, and the worship is from the praise of God, because it is for the knowledge, The positive is obligated by the prohibition on the opposite in the sentence, and we do not see in it a bad, or from the guidance of the straight path, if I want the religion of Islam, or from the one who says: The last of his comment, or from you, we are worshiped, for it is a news about his specialization with worship, and it is realizing the slave of the slave of the slave of the They are worshiped, and he does not respond to the dismissal of the precedent of a matter and forbids originally, and he is obligated to us after the numbers of God, and the righteousness is that The chest is what is guided to it, not in particular, and may God bless him and grant him peace be upon him His Excellency said: You have been blessed with them other than those who are angry with them or from the Day of Religion, that is, the penalty, and the reward is either what is easy or what is harmful, and they are the reward, but the reward, but the reward, but the reward, but the reward, but the reward, but the reward, This is because the messengers of the messengers and the books of the books are the mercy of the worshipers, and a guidance to what they reconcile with a pension, and a return.The connection to it is what is bound by the one, and the increased is done by work and disturbance, and the communication is what is led by it to the return of the argument, and the abuse of the one, The knowledge of the definition of the one with it with the investigator, and the introduction of the definition with the descriptions of the majesty and the beauty, and from it what is from it, is the landing, the removal, and the one between the one, and the one who is the one, By God, His attributes, prophecies, and re -metaphor, and worship, can be able to communicate and communicate, and enter into it from the face of faith, and what is in the face The book, and the angels, as the matter and the forbidden are the province of that in the sentence, and the promise and the feast include belief in the restoration, and they are on the authority of the worship, and the people are not like, and there is no Rahela, and most of them were sent by desire and dread, and their mediators are hopeful and fearful, and the properties and a little are human and hidden, With the three, the guidance was made to the reconciliation of the pension and the restoration, and I do not limit you to the face of the confusion with this, so the misfortune of the mortal is a breadth, and you are to return the three to the three, and the three of the two Worship, as there is no judgment for the mind, and perhaps he made him a crop for him, asking that the thanks of the blessing is a reason, and it is a reason for the one who is a mind.Thus, he crossed what he crossed from the article, or to disobey it on the sentence of its suffering from the theory wisdom, and the rulings of the process that are the peace of the path, The paths of the pricing, the homes of the hardships, and the first (P-36) are beneficial from the first surah to his saying: The Day of Religion and the second is from his saying: I do not worship The straight, from his saying: The guidance of the verse, and the view of his saying: You have been blessed with them, etc.The preaching, as well as supplication and praise, and this is the sentence of Quranic.Religion, (the first) is the knowledge of the origins, and its handicapped is the knowledge of God, the Exalted, and his attributes, and the sign of his saying: The Lord of the two worlds, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.By saying the Almighty: You have been blessed with them and the mummy to him by saying the Almighty: Malik on the Day of Religion.(The second) The knowledge of the vocals, and the worshipers of the worship, which is intended to say it: I do not worship it and it is a minor and financial, and they are separated to the matters of pensioners from the pension The rules, so the branches threatened to reach, (the third) is the knowledge of what it has, and it is the knowledge of the ethical, and the sake of the prayer is to the presence of al -Samadiyyah The fee is in the homes of these high ranks, and the signal is by saying: And we seek help from the righteous, the righteous (the lord), the knowledge of the one) Salaf Al -Da’i and Al -Ashqaya, and what is connected to it from the promise and the return, and it is what is meant by the words of the high You came in simplified from that, and these two sacrifices call for the book of the book on the suffering, or its estimation in the additional installation, and the first face does not, and this is the one who does not.And if it is more accurate and more beautiful, not because it is formed on them that it is stated that the conqueror shall be amended by the two thirds Another third of the reward, which Al -Shihab said, and then he said: It is wondering what was said here that this is because of its insult to the connotation of guarantee, and the commitment, and they are the same, From this, his mercy God is with what Diyami narrated in the Faris on the authority of Abu Al -Darada: The opening of the book is rewarded for what is not rewarded for the Qur’an, and if the book of the book is made, it was made in the palm of the book.The Qur’an is in the other palm, as it was preferred by the book of the book on the Qur’an seven times, for it is only one of the preferences in the reward, so he rejoices the appearance of that He promoted him, and on his face, the owner of the gossip does not oppose, yes, that it is distant, and it is possible to separate between the two experts, and with it the forms of the first and the first of the first, and the first of the first, and the first of the first A stone on the wide mercy, or by the fact that the essay is disturbed to disturb the situation, or by that what the whole thing is amended by all of it Prayer, the same in his saying: The Qur’an is the Qur’an.Let him manage, and on the ills, it is not measured by what was said in the face of the name with that, because it is the best of the light, or because it was forbidden as the forbidden of the Qur’an, or the sake of the Qur’an, or the sake of the Qur’an.Faith is to it, or because it is a judge, and the arbitrators are the mother of the book, and I do not subjugate some of the integrity of the rituals because the face of the name is not obligatory, and it is not necessary for you And peace be upon you, (it is not said): If the conqueror is a gathering because of the suffering of the book, then the seven of it fell from the righteousness of the fruit, the gym, the goodness, the Zayy, the shin, and the shame.That is for the indication that the meaning of the mean is not obligated by the acre.The abuse of many of the secrets, and it was from the shadow of the darkness that was not found in the similar one from the ills of the light, and the collection after the projection of the ritual: We hold it) and it is the Nuraniya, which is intersted from its light family of the reference to the dominance of the camels on the majesty that feels that it is repeated what is indicated by the mercy of the The remaining seven of this type, so the Nuraniya breaks down to know that the matter is distorted, and the deception of God is not safe The Forgiving, the Most Merciful, and that my torment is the painful torment, a sign and any sign of that for those who contemplate the state of the two sentences, that in the form of the Nuraniya, which is four of the fourth (P-37) with its perfection, and the shadow is a seven of it, and if the Sundays are touched, Nurani will be with him a shadow, and a pure and a pure sign of the sake of the sake of the sake, The light of his faith did not like the injustice of his transgression, and a believer has been young, and there is a symbol that there is no contradiction between faith and disobedience, so do not be guided Its injustice is its light, "(and the adulterer does not admit while he is a believer)" The arrogance of the advertisement, the male is the light, referring to the civilized believer, and the corrupted mail referring to the confused believer, it appears in the For itself, and from them, it is a source, and some of them are preceded by the goodness of God, that is the great grace.The stabilizer is dropped and the fall is fixed, or a seventh is taken from this, and this is for the pleasure of his knowledge, and he ignorant of his ignorance, yes, yes, Referring to the fact that the Guyg is in the eye, and the eye is in the between, for this is the head of the veil and the clothes of the clothes, and this is what is erased for our proverbs from the secrets of the book of God Almighty, and where is it The monsters from its seas, who are misleading from the water of its secrets.And for us, the knowledge of the good religion in this denomination is a word that is not in investigator, the lowest imam, as he made the causes of this virginity, so that it is the sacrifice, so that it is a good It is indicated by the coffee, and the gym is the first letter from Hell, and the fear is felt by the treasury, and the Zay and the shin are from the exhalation and the righteous, and the okay is denied, and it is denied, And the first shadow in his saying is up to the Almighty: they went into a shadow with three peoples and also indicating a shadow, and fulfillment of the separation, then he said: If they said: There is no letter Reminded in the name of something that requires a kind of torment, so it does not remain because you are mentioned, so we say: The one is in it is that he said in the description of the hell of Hell: A part of a divided and then the highest seven of the forefathers from this surah, and it is the firsts of the conservative indication of the torment, alerting it to the one who has read it, and the one who reads it, Its truths, it became safe from the seven parties in hell, ended, and he does not hide what is in it, and his answer does not benefit him and does not enrich him, as he said to say: And the eye, the eye, the m and the guy, as the waw is from the wealth, the wasting of humiliation, the noun is from the fire, and the H is from the gums, and the eye is from the torment, and the meme is from the dirt, and the guy is from the The people of the fire, and the benefit is in its overthrow as the one who is in the abuse of that, from the same difference in the first place, that in his words, may God have mercy From what was said, or it is said, I do not go ahead with pride, and he is the master who has become the end of the religion, and the argument of Islam, and the support of his family, and as for his attribution (P-38) (P-38) On the authority of God, the Exalted Him and his face when he asked the Romans Mua’awah.On that, he was not obligated, and he asked on me and he answered, so he did not pray for him, and on the ability of peace, then what is the honor of the Emir is to be satisfied with this place, but it is not for him It is hidden from you from the secrets, so it is an understanding of that, and God Almighty takes over your guidance.(Fifth, its sixth, and its seven), the treasure, the foolishness, and the sufficient, because of the passage of its detection on the curtains, so it is sufficient and sufficient, or because it is not described in the prayer Others, (eight) is the basis, because it is the origin of the Qur’an and the first surah in it, (and the ninth and its adore, and the only one and the second is twenty and the third is the same).Supplication, the surah of the question, and the surah of the question, to show it on that, as for its disgrace on the praise, it is an appearance, and so on the thank you, for the one who is the best of God.To be asian as the mother of the Qur’an and the mother of the book.As for the third of the third, it is the case of the first, but rather the appearance.The third and the four as it is not hidden, (and the fourth is ten and the fifteenth).We seek help, and the following is the twenty -one, the sixteenth and the twelve eighth) is the tenderness, the healing and the healing, and the authentic hadiths of the righteousness ( Ten) the surah of prayer is because it is a duty or a child in it, and the junction is the gold of some of the Mujahidin, and a narration from the one in the nose, and it is said: (I divided the prayer between me and between Abdi Nasfin), and wanted the surah, and the linguistic metaphor for the relationship of the kidneys and parties, or the necessity of the righteousness, as a right Obtained, (and ten) the light for its appearance as a lot The Qur’an, (and the ten and ten) the great Qur’an, which is the back of what we presented, (and the second and ten) are the second seven because it is seven verses with an agreement, and what we have seen.And the saying that it is eight is like a saying that it is an abnormal nine that is not packed with, or an illusion from the one, except that some of them are the one who is the name of the name, without what you have done, The narration, so the second does not sign that the adultery of the verse does not suit the adultery of the connections of the light, on the authority of the Surah of victory, what is from this section, and it is praised and repeated in all the rituals, Or the most emotional, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is not the one who is the one who is not the one who is the one who is the one who is not the one is the one who does not want to pray, does not want the ritual prayer, and the prayer of the funeral is that there are no disagreement, and the prayer of the funeral is a supplication, and there is no prayer, and it is a prayer.That is because it is praised by a wall Other, or because it has come down two times, or because it is on two sections of supplication and a blessing, or because it is the same as the servant reads from it a verse of God, the Almighty, with the authority The famous, and it was said otherwise, and these sayings are based on that the second is from the trinity, and it is necessary to be from the praise of what is in it, or for the one who is in it.It is praise for those who recite it, and that it be from the second because God Almighty has excluded it for this nation and praise be to God for this grace, then the ruling, then Like the books, it is a dispute of Lazakhi to be active for the reader, and I send the crime like the migrant if he cut off a mile or a fracture of the soul of that The preservation took the surah, who was believed that he took from the book of God, the transcendent sect, so he grew up with what he kept, and also the genius, if it is fold It is under it a single door, with the fact that the universe of the wall of the wall with its inception is miraculous and one of the verses of God Almighty, and the ruling is in its place.The Quranic researcher is the opening of the book in it, so they are more than an angel, but rather from the parents of the Qur’an, which is the narrator, and it is the one who is on the authority of Ali And the most companions, and on the authority of Mujahid that it is a civilian, and it has been separated with that, until it is a matter The kiss was transformed, to know that it is in the prayer as it was, and it was said: Some of it is an angel and some are a civilian, and his weakness is not hidden, and the people of the people have been hidden from the people In the verse of the stone: And we have given you seven of the second and the great Qur’an and it is an angel of the text of the scholars and the narration from Ibn Abbas, and it has no ruling, and there is no ruling for it In the right of the people of Mecca as it was said, because it is based on the fact that the angel was not in the right of the people of Mecca, the famous of its disagreement, and the strongest of the righteous from the ritual They witnessed the revelation and the download, because that is a first place for the interpretation of the second seven with the conquest, and it is if it is correct in the hadiths, except that it is true He is a homes and otherwise its interpretation of the seventh long, and secondly on the abuse of the two who are given to the distress before his gossip with the fact that God Almighty has blessed God and may God bless him and grant him peace With matters before his giving to you, as he said: “We open up for you, and it is clear, and it is before the conquest in the years, and the abbrection is for the past The disagreement of the phenomenon, especially with the revenue of the mother, and the word (may), and its coldness in the exposure of the time, and the dominant in it is the precedent of the fall, and the kindness: and do not give it to you.However, it is The evidence has been scratched, it is not said: This and that are not indicated except that it was descended with a king, and as for the denial of its descent in the city (p-34), it is not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not, The original, and on the prosecutors of the evidence, and I am with it, and what they said in the answer to the synthesis that the descent is a back from the world of the unseen to the testimony, and the appearance of it is not accepted.The phenomenon of the appearance of heroes, as the fact that it was the case that it was in every one for a sake, or that it was on a letter once and another one to the roses (your money) and (Malik), or (Malik) Tara, and a bodies, and with it the doctrine and the narratives are corrected for the fall, which has no obligatory, as it is not hidden, and the surah is a matter of whom is the most important, if it is a matter It is the rest, because the rest of everything is, and its beginnings, if it is from the wall of construction, which is the house or the wall of the city to surround its verses, or from the And the reaction to its reaction to its formation, as the words of God Almighty, and the homes are called the ravine, as in the saying of the naps: It is lying in a Quran that is covered by a light and a conclusion, and it was said: a transitional sect, to come out of the verse of the chair, and it is stained, and it was stained, All of the hadiths and antiquities, whoever said in his hatred to be said: a surah such, but a surah that is mentioned in it, such as this, based on what was narrated on the authority of Anas and Ibn Umar, from the one who is from it, The hadith of a weak or a mandate, and the hadith of Ibn Omar is on the authority of it, and if it was narrated from it with a Sahih bond, and the conqueror in the original is a ritual, the one who made it.To be a median in the opening of all, and the transmission of the transmission, or the exaggeration, and I do not take it with a lamb or the source of the launch of the first, and it was released to the first A notification of his saliva, as if the same is the same, as he attached it to him first, and then by his midst, he is attached to the group to be a part of it.The last is exposing the last first, and all by its midst, and this is not the first to a few effective in the sources, except that it is first of his cousin for the family, or a bone, or a bone, or a bone, or a bone, or a bone, or a baaas With the verb and comparison of it, and the majority is that the machine does not describe, and the scholarship is not compared, that the machine here is not appropriate to delude that some will be the same It will be for the lineage, that is, the same opening, with the most desperate faces, (and the book) is the group of the person, and the conquest of the conquest of the measure is not to it, not to it, not to it.Its parts, and it is achieved in the knowledge, the inspiration, or the house of the pride, so it is not visiting in the shores of the surah in this name in the first, and the first addition of the addition of the name, to the name, to the name, And the second in the sense of the mother is as part The thing is not in the sense of (from), as in the conclusion of a silver because the added is a part of the sheikh of Islam, and it is some of some people in each, and the son of Kaysan and Al -Sayrafi said: (From) Al -Tabadiyyah, but rather in the luminous and its explanation: It is estimated in the addition, as well Bayaniyah is divorced, and some of them were specially specialized in general, and the deserted privacy as in the example, and made it in the divorced as a city of Baghdad, a mother and the month.And for this generous surah is the names that some are reached to a nose and ten years, one of which is the opening of the book, because it is its principle on the path of the righteous, not because it is in the time The learning, and in the reading in the prayer, as the imam al -Sayuti claimed it, nor because it was the first surah that came down as it was said, but the first and the third is because the principle is from the principle of You call for the observance of the synchronization in the rest of the parts of the book from your two, and there is no doubt that the learning and the Nazouli are not as well as the second I know (P-35) that what is meant by the book is not true to the one who is read in the prayer until it is considered a name for it, and it is the beginning of it, That is because it is the first surah that was written in the wave, and it needs a transmission, and if it is correct that it is correct the Qur’an, which is in our Qur’an as in the lap, then the ritual The one was written, and the dominance of the suspicion is another matter, (and the second) is the opening of the Qur’an, because we did the example of the calm with the slander, (and the third and its righteousness) (Do not say one of you, the mother of the book, and he says: the opening of the book), “I do not pray for it, but it has been established in the chapter, it is called it, as it is not hidden from the one, and it is not hidden from the The appetite is a book, a recitation, or a descent on a saying or a prayer in it, and after that it is followed, it is like the mother who forms the child after her, and it is said to the mother, and it is also said to the mother: To present it and follow the army for it, and it is the mother of the villages, or to disobey it as the science said on the purposes of the suffering in the Qur’an from the praise of God, and it is the one who is God.With the matter and the forbidden, and from the return, the praise is back, and the worship is from the praise of God because it is for the knowledge, so it is valid for the affairs of the affairs On the authority of the sentence in the sentence, and we do not see it in it, or from the guidance of the straight path, if I want the religion of Islam, or from the estimation of the people, and from the name of God, and from the name of God.Either from you worship, it is a news about his specialization with worship, and it is the verification of the slave of the person who has commanded the master or forbade, so it is permissible in the sentence They are worshiped, and he does not respond to the precedent of a precedent and forbid at all, and he is obligated to us after we receive the numbers for the pronouncement, and that the ritual of the ritual He is guided to him, not in particular, and may God bless him and grant him peace be upon him, and the glorification of the Surah, You have been blessed with them, other than the one who is angry, or from the Day of Religion, that is, the penalty, and the reward is either that is easy or what is harmful, and they are the reward and the punishment, but it was the one that is the one who is The mission of the messengers and the books of the books for the servants, and the guidance of what they reconcile with a pension, and return, and that is known to those who are able to communicate the blessing, With what is bound by the one, and the increased is done by work and disturbance, and the connection is what is led by it to the return of the attachment, and the prevention of the one who is the one who is a heart, and the hearts of the heart, The one who is with him with the investigators, and the introduction of the knowledge of the majesty and camels enters the attributes of the majesty and the camels, and from it what is the transmission, the landing and the recession between the obedient, and the sinner, and the one who enters the faith His attributes, prophecies, and repetitions, and worship, can be able to communicate and communicate, and enter into it from the face of faith in the prophets, and what is attached to it, and what is attached to it.And the angels, as the matter and the forbidden are the provision of that in the sentence, and the promise and the boundary include faith in the restoration, and they are subjected to worship, and the people are not like, and the people are not like a And the most of them, the desire of desire and dread, and their mediators are hopeful and fearful, and the properties and a few are the people and the hibernation, for the three of the righteousness, and the righteousness, and the righteousness of the I confine to you the face of the confinement with this, so the misfortune is a breadth, and you are to return the three to two, so the praise is perpetuated in the worship, for the sake of the sake of the sake of the sake of the He made him a cruelty to him, until the thanks of the blessing is a mind, and observing the dementia, and the goodness did not take place, so that it is a good one, To show it on the sentence of its suffering from the theoretical wisdom, the referendum of the operation that is the rooted paths of the path, and the knowledge of the paths of the pricing (P-36) It is beneficial from the first surah to his saying: The Day of Religion and the second is from his saying: You are worshiped and after it, and your souls are the righteous path, from the saying, from the saying: And knowledge of his saying: You have been blessed with them, etc., and in it a promise and a return, so they entered it, and the proverbs and the stories are intended by the preacher, and the supplication, and the supplication, and the supplication, The Qur’an is a precious and obligatory The fundamentals, and its contract is the knowledge of God Almighty, and his attributes, and the sign of his saying: the Lord of the two worlds, the Most Merciful, and the knowledge of the prophets, which is the one who says: They are upon them and the mummy to him by saying the Almighty: Malik on the Day of Religion.(The second) The knowledge of the vocals, and the worshipers of the worship, which is intended to say it: I do not worship it and it is a minor and financial, and they are separated to the matters of pensioners from the pension The rules, so the branches threatened to reach, (the third) is the knowledge of what it has, and it is the knowledge of the ethical, and the sake of the prayer is to the presence of al -Samadiyyah The fee is in the homes of these high ranks, and the signal is by saying: And we seek help from the righteous, the righteous (the lord), the knowledge of the one) Salaf Al -Da’i and Al -Ashqaya, and what is connected to it from the promise and the return, and it is what is meant by the words of the high You came in simplified from that, and these two sacrifices call for the book of the book on the suffering, or its estimation in the additional installation, and the first face does not, and this is the one who does not.And if it is more accurate and more beautiful, not because it is formed on them that it is stated that the conqueror shall be amended by the two thirds Another third of the reward, which Al -Shihab said, and then he said: It is wondering what was said here that this is because of its insult to the connotation of guarantee, and the commitment, and they are the same, From this, his mercy, may God have mercy on him with what Dilmi narrated in the Faris on the authority of my father Al -Daradaa: In the palm of the balance, the Qur’an was made in the other palm, as the book of the book was made on the Qur’an seven times, so it is only disturbed by the virtue in the reward That is the news of his success, and on the face of the owner of the said, do not oppose, yes, that it is far, and it is possible to fulfill between the two expertise, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was The reward is doubled second, nor a stone on the wide mercy, or by the fact that the article is disturbed to disagree with the situation, or by what the whole thing that is the same, or the one who is the same, or the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same, Or in them in the sense of prayer, the same in his saying: And the Qur’an of immorality is that the Qur’an was a martyrdom, and that is different from being disturbed by the oppression of the people of the people Their prayers, let him manage, and on the illness, it is not measured by what was said in the face of the name with that, because it is the best of the light, or because it was forbidden, as it is forbidden, or for the sake of the Qur’an, The people of faith are so far to be, or because it is an arbitrator, And the courts are the mother of the book, and I do not expose some to the integrity of the rituals because the face of the name does not have to be stirred, but I am the most important thing for you, Al -Fateh was a gathering because of the suffering of the book, so he did not fall from the seven of the rituals of the dé The meaning is not obligated by the academic talisman, nor is it shortened by its deficiency, that God is the Almighty and does not look at your images, and it was seven in accordance with the number of the number of the verse The secrets, and it was one of the shadows that were not found in the similar ones from the ills of the light, and the collection after the projection of the deceased: (a path to the right of the right) It is included in its light families to refer to the dominance of the camels on the majesty, which feels that it will be repeated what is indicated The species is the evangelization of Nurani to know that the matter is disturbing, and the deception of God is not safe It is the painful torment of a sign and any sign of that to those who contemplate the state of the two sentences, that in the form of the Nuraniya, which is four ten, a remote letters (P-37) (P-37) (P-37) It is mentioned by a seventh, and if the ones are touched, a light is with him, a shadow, and a pure and pure, referring to the divided sections of the believers, and the believer is not a believer.His transgression, and a believer has a young man, and there is a symbol that there is no contradiction between faith and disobedience.And the search is not for this, and if the fallen is noticed, which is the shadow of the custodian, referring to the cordial oppressor, the fall of the arrogance, and the masculine is the light, the light is the The pure believer, and the corrupted light, referring to the confused believer, the secret of the triangle appears in: It is a unjust to its soul, and from them is the one who is a source That is the great preference, but the fuller was the seven with its own characteristics from the four of that four, and it was not reflected, so the stabilizer will be taken, or the stabilizer, and the stabilizer, Seven of this is taken from this, and this is to make his knowledge, and ignorance of those who ignored him, yes, in the form of the fallen, so that he said that he was not in the eyes, and this is in the eye, and this is in the eye.The hijab and the carpets obtained, and this is what we swear to our proverbs from the secrets of the book of God Almighty, and where is it what appears to the unlikes who are mired from his sailors, the one who is a good.And for us, the knowledge of the good religion in this denomination is a word that is not in the verbal verification of the lowest The forefathers are that it is feelings of torment, the garment is indicative of the dirt, and the gym is the first letters of hell, and the khur feels the treasury, and the Zayyeh, the shin, and the exhale, It is denied by al -Zaqum, and the shin is denoted by the misery, and the first shadow in its saying is up to the Almighty: they went to the shadow of three peoples and also that it is indicated by the righteousness, and the one who said: If they said: There is no letter from the letters except when it is mentioned in the name of something that requires a kind of torment, so it does not remain for what you mentioned is a good, so we say: It has seven chapters, each of which is a part of them, and then it is the highest of seven of the letters from this surah, and it is the first to be a sign of the torment of the torment of the This surah, and believed in it, and defined its entitlements, became safe from the seven parties in hell, ended, and he does not hide what is in it, and his answer does not benefit from it, and he does not benefit from it, and he does not.Let the dhikm, the waw, the noun, the b, the eye, the m and the guarantee, are the wow from the money, and the wasting of humiliation, and the noun from the fire, and the hm from the gum, and the eye, and the eye from the The richness is from the Gawashi, the verses are back, and everyone is in the people of the fire, and the good will be in its overthrow as the beneficial in the projection That is, but with the peace of his peace from what was said, or is it said, I do not go to pride, and he is the master who has become the end of the religion, and the pretext of Islam, His attribution (P-38) to the Commander of the Faithful, upon the honorable of God, the Almighty and his face when he asked the Romans, he asked him, so he did not answer, so he would not be answered.For him, and on the ability of peace, what is the honor of the Emir with the sufficiency of this approach except the alert to the questioners of what is not hidden from you from the secrets, so that it is so, so that it is so, so it is so.This is.(Fifth, its sixth, and its seven), the treasure, the foolishness, and the sufficient, because of the passage of its detection on the curtains, so it is sufficient and sufficient, or because it is not described in the prayer Others, (eight) is the basis, because it is the origin of the Qur’an and the first surah in it, (and the ninth and its adore, and the only one and the second is twenty and the third is the same).Supplication, the surah of the question, and the surah of the question, to show it on that, as for its disgrace on the praise, it is an appearance, and so on the thank you, for the one who is the best of God.To be asian as the mother of the Qur’an and the mother of the book.As for the third of the third, it is the case of the first, but rather the appearance.The third and the lifted as it is not hidden, (and the fourth is ten and the fifteenth) Surah The survivors, and the wig of the convergence, because the servant is calling his Lord with his saying: Naad and you are sought after, and the following is the severity of the severity, ( The eighth is ten), the tenderness, the healing and the healing, and the authentic hadiths are poetic, (and the ninth is ten).Some of the Mujahidin, and a narration from the one in the nose, it was said: It is one of its names to pray for the hadith: Because of the complexity of the whole and partiality or the rule of judgment, such as the metaphor in the deletion, it is an inner For its destiny, or because it is because of the suffering of the suffering of the light in the sense of the Qur’an, (the only one The twenty) is the second seven because it is seven verses with an agreement, and what we have seen is a common thing for it only “I saw” and the saying that it is a number of people as saying that it is a ninth of an anomalous Al -Rawi, except that some of them are the one who promised the name without you, and among them is the opposite of them, and the path of narration, so the second does not delighted that the adultery of the verse is not the right of the verse.That in the surah of victory is what is from this section, and it is praised and rejected in every rak'ah and prayer with a kneeling, or the devoted, and the one who is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one On the basis of the bodies, and the prayer of the funeral is a supplication, not a righteous prayer, and it was said: It was described with that because it is praised by the other wall, or because it is for me, or because it is a matter Two parts of supplication and a blessing, or because it is the same as the servant reads from it a verse that God has exalted with the news of his action as in the hadith of the famous, and it is the same, and it is not.A building on the second to be from the trinity, and it is necessary to be of praise for the praise of God, or when he returned from the praise of the one who is from the praise of whom it is from the praise The second is because God Almighty has excluded it for this nation and praise be to God for this grace, and then the rule in the mourning of the Qur’an is like a way that is a light He was active for the reader, and he sent the crops like the traveler if he cut off a mile or a firmness, he breathed from him, and active for the walk, and if he takes the preserved, he takes the preserved.The book of God is a transcendent sect, so he grew up with what he has preserved, and also the snake if it is folded under it, types and kinds of kindness, it was better than that of the door, and it is the best of it.The fact that the universe of the surah is fulfilled by its miracle and a miracle of the verses of God, and the ruling is in its place long and short, and it appears to be hidden.Researcher The Qur’an is the opening of the book in it, so they are more than an angel, but rather from the parents of the Qur’an on a saying, and it is the narrator on the authority of Ali And the most companions, and on the authority of Mujahid that it is a civilian, and it has been separated with that, until it is a matter The kiss was transformed, to know that it is in the prayer as it was, and it was said: Some of it is an angel and some are a civilian, and his weakness is not hidden, and the people of the people have been hidden from the people In the verse of the stone: And we have given you seven of the second and the great Qur’an and it is an angel of the text of the scholars and the narration from Ibn Abbas, and it has no ruling, and there is no ruling for it In the right of the people of Mecca as it was said, because it is based on the fact that the angel was not in the right of the people of Mecca, the famous of its disagreement, and the strongest of the righteous from the ritual They witnessed the revelation and the download, because that is a first place for the interpretation of the second seven with the conquest, and it is if it is correct in the hadiths, except that it is true He is a homes and otherwise its interpretation of the seventh long, and secondly on the abuse of the two who are given to the distress before his gossip with the fact that God Almighty has blessed God and may God bless him and grant him peace With matters before his giving to you, as he said: “We open up for you, and it is clear, and it is before the conquest in the years, and the abbrection is for the past The disagreement of the phenomenon, especially with the revenue of the mother, and the word (may), and its coldness in the exposure of the time, and the dominant in it is the precedent of the fall, and the kindness: and do not give it to you.However, it was not said that this is not said: This is not indicated that it was descended with Mecca, and as for the negation of its descent in the city (P-33) The negation is the original, and on the prosecutors of the confirmation and that I am, and what they said in the answer to the symptoms that the descent is an appearance from the world of the unseen to the testimony, and the appearance of it is not.The appearance of the appearance of the heroes, as the case of the pretext that it was in every one for a sake, or that it was on a letter again and another other for the (money) With a lame, and a bodies, and with it, the doctrine and the narratives are correct to the fall of the fall, which is not obligatory, as it is not hidden, and the surah is not a matter.It was one of the seams, which is the rest, because the rest of everything is some of it, and it is his beginning if it is from the wall of construction, which is the house or the wall of the city, to surround it.It is the high and the rush to reiterate it as the words of God Almighty, and the house is called the ravine, as in the saying of the nap About it, it is lying in the Quran It is included in the light and a conclusion, and it was said: a transmitted sect, to come out of the verse of the chair, transmitted in a way, and the names of the whole have been established, and the names of the whole said, In his hatred, it is said: a surah such, but a surah that is mentioned in it, as this is based on what was narrated on the authority of Anas and Ibn Omar from the forbidden of that, and it is not accustomed to it, as it is a matter And the hadith of Ibn Omar is a man who is on it, and if it was narrated from it with a correct bond, and the conqueror in the original is a loyalty that was made either for the first thing, to be the one who is in the first place To be transferred, or the exaggeration, and I do not have a sign of a mark or a source that was called the first to be named for the verb, as the source is notice The conquest, as he attached to it at first, and then by its midst, it is attached to the group for its formation in part of it, and so is it said in the conclusion, then the one is the one who is the same By his midst, and this is not the first to a few effective in the sources, except that it is first of his being for the family, or a bone, because this is a compassion, and the absence of it That the machine does not describe, and the motive is not compared, as the machine is not appropriate for it to be deluded that some should be uninterrupted, and they are permissible to be the same.With the most desperate faces, (and the book) is the group of the person, and the conquest of the conquest of the measure to it, not to the blessed destiny between it and between the parts of it, Loop or the house of pride, so there is no harm in the fever of the surah in this name in the first, and the first addition of the addition of the name to the name, which is a famous, and the second is in the same way The thing is not in the sense of (from), as in the conclusion of a silver because the added is a part of the sheikh of Islam, and it is some of some people in each, and the son of Kaysan and Al -Sayrafi said: (From) Al -Tabadiyyah, but rather in the luminous and its explanation: It is estimated in the addition, as well Bayaniyah is divorced, and some of them were specially specialized in general, and the deserted privacy as in the example, and made it in the divorced as a city of Baghdad, a mother and the month.And for this generous surah is the names that some are reached to a nose and ten years, one of which is the opening of the book, because it is its principle on the path of the righteous, not because it is in the time The learning, and in the reading in the prayer, as the imam al -Sayuti claimed it, nor because it was the first surah that came down as it was said, but the first and the third is because the principle is from the principle of You call for the observance of the synchronization in the rest of the parts of the book from your two, and there is no doubt that the learning and the Nazouli are not as well as the second I know (P-35) that It is not intended for the book, the righteous, the righteous, what is read in the prayer until it is considered a name for it, and it was narrated that it is the name of it.Surah was written in the wave, and it needs a transmission, and if it is correct that the Quran that is in our Qur’an is corrected, as in the Law, then perhaps the following is written, then the following is written.And the prevalence of the suspicion is another matter, (and the second) is the opening of the Qur’an, when we have come to the example of the calf with the slander, (and its third and its lord) the mother of the book and the mother of the Qur’an, and the hadeeth of the Qur’an: The book, and to say: the opening of the book), “I do not pray for it, but it has been established in the chapter, its name is with it, as it is not hidden from the follower, and it is called, and it is called for the sake of the following, and it is called.A recitation or a descent on a saying or a prayer in it, and after that it is followed, it is like the mother who is formed by the child after her, and it is also said to the righteousness: the mother of the mother For her, and from him the mother of the villages, or for its insults as the science said on the purposes of the suffering in the Qur’an from the praise of God, the Most High, and from the God, and from the one who is the one, and from the worship, and from the worshiper As for praise, it is an appearance, and the worship is from the praise of God because it is for the knowledge, and it is estimated that it is beneficial to it, and the positive matter is that it is obligatory in the authority of the In it is a good, or from the guidance of the straight path, if I want the religion of Islam, or from the appreciation of those who say: in the name of God, and from the delay of the one who is attached It is a news about his specialization with worship, and it is realizing the slave of the person who is the master of the master or forbidden, so it is indicated in the sentence that they are worshiped, and there is no worshiper The precedent of a matter of origin and the origin of the origin, and it is obligatory for us after the numbers of the pronouncement of the pronouncement that the heads of worship are the beyond To be completed by God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, with al -Huhidiya and the chapter of the surah, and that is enough, and the promise and the bound are from the saying of God: On the day of the Day of Religion, that is, the penalty, and the rewarding either what is easy or harmful, and they are the reward and punishment, but the intentions were that this is because the messenger is the one For worshipers, and guidance to what they reconcile with a pension, and a return, and that with the knowledge of those who appreciate the delivery of blessings, and more, then the connection to what is not Increased and disturbing, and communicating from what is required to be the return of the attachment, and the prevention of the stallion is a heart and bodies, and the praise is the branch of the knowledge The investigator, and the introduction of the knowledge of the majestic and beautiful attributes, including the transmission, the removal, and the deviation between the obedient, and the sinner, and the faith entered the faith and the righteousness And the repetition of the bulls, and the worship is able to communicate and communicate, and in which the face of belief in the prophets is entered into it The rumor of the evidence of that in the sentence, the promise and the boundary include the faith in the restoration, and they are sent to worship, and the people are like a hundred camels that you do not find in it, Desire and terrifying, and their mediators are hopeful and fearful, and the properties and a few are human and hidden.In this, the mockery of the mourning is a breadth, and you are to return the three to two, so the praise is included in the worship, as there is no judgment for the mind, and it is for the sake of it Until the thank you is a reasonable mind, taking into account the delay of the retreat, and the whiteness did not wake up with that, so he crossed what he crossed from the article, or for the one who has the authority, or for the one who has the same.The theoretical wisdom, the practical judgments that are the righteous paths of the path, and the view of the trays of the pricing, the homes of the hardships, and the first (P-36) to benefit from the first His saying: The Day of Religion and the second is from his saying: We do not worship and after it, and the righteous path On them, etc., in which there is a promise and a return, so they entered it, and the proverbs and the stories that are intended with the preacher, as well as the supplication and the blessing, and this is the sentence of the Qur’an.It is more simplified by this that it is said: It is a disgrace to four types of the sciences that are the areas of religion, (the first) the knowledge of the origins, and its handicapped is the knowledge of God.With his saying: The Lord of the Merciful, the Most Merciful, and the knowledge of the prophets, and it is intended with his saying, the Almighty: You have been blessed with them and the mummy to him.(The second) The knowledge of the vocals, and the worshipers of the worship, which is intended to say it: I do not worship it and it is a minor and financial, and they are separated to the matters of pensioners from the pension The rules, so the branches threatened to reach, (the third) is the knowledge of what it has, and it is the knowledge of the ethical, and the sake of the prayer is to the presence of al -Samadiyyah The fee is in the homes of these high ranks, and the signal is by saying: And we seek help from the righteous, the righteous (the lord), the knowledge of the one) Salaf Al -Da’i and Al -Ashqaya, and what is connected to it from the promise and the return, and it is what is meant by the words of the high You came in simplified of that, and these two sacrifices are calling for the book of the book on the suffering, or its appreciation in the additional installation, And the first face does not require it and from this, the bit of it is, and if it is more accurate and more, not because it is formed on them when it is mentioned that the conqueror is the same as the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The stomach is not equal to detailing, the increase in its buildings is a house that is one third of the reward, and the meteor said, then he said: It is wonder what was said here is that that is for you to do so.Inclusion, and commitment, and they are the third of the connotations, and I say: the most surprising of this is the most merciful of God, with what Dilmi narrated in the Farda from Abu al -Darwah: It is permissible for something that is not rewarded from the Qur’an, even if the opening of the book was made in the palm of the balance, and the Qur’an was made in the other palm, it was preferred to be the fatwa of the Qur’an.Mitteries, because he is not dismissed from him except for the reward in the reward, so he will oppose his appearance that news of his success, and on the face of the owner, the owner of the said, does not contradict it, Exclusivity between the two experts, and with it the forms goes away by the fact that the first was the first and the multiplicity of rewards secondly, nor a stone on the wide mercy, or that the disagreement of the state is the case, or that it is the case of the state of The whole thing is amended by its thirds, or by the Qur’an in one of the two experts or in them in the sense of prayer, the same is the same in his saying: The Qur’an is the Qur’an that was the Qur’an.Thus, it is different from being dismissed by the paths of people in their readers and their prayers, so he should be managed, and on the ills, they are not measured by what was said in the face of the name, because it is the same Because it was forbidden as the prohibition of the Qur’an, or because it is the fear of the people of faith to it, or because it is a judge, and the courts are the mother of the book, and I do not supply The face of the name is not obligatory, but I delegate the matter to you, and the peace of God is upon you, (it is not said): If the conqueror is a gathering of the suffering of the book, then the book is from it I know the dé Excellency does not look at your images, and it was seven in accordance with the number of the verse that includes many of the secrets, and it was from the shadows of the darkness that was not found The light, and it is collected after the projection of the deceased: (a path on the right to hold it), which is the mauran, which is covered by it with its light family to the sign of the majesty to the greatness of the With it, it is reducing what indicates the mercy in Al -Fateh, but the remaining seven did not fall from this species, so the Nurani will be cleared to know that the matter is not.Except the losing people, and in the words of the Almighty: I predict my servants that I am the Forgiving, the Most Merciful And that my torment is the painful torment of a sign and any sign of that for those who contemplate the state of the two sentences, on the authority of the Nuraniyyah, which is four twenty letters (P-37) (P-37) (P-37) (P-37) (P-37) (P-37) (P-37) p The shadow is a seven of which is mentioned, and if the ones are tubed, a light with it is shadowed, and a pure maure, referring to the two days of the believers, His faith is the injustice of his transgression, and a believer has a young man, and there is a symbol that there is no contradiction between faith and disobedience, so do not guarantee the injustice of his light, " On the fullness, and the search is for this, and if the fallen is noticed, which is the shadow of the cordon, referring to the cordial, fall of the arrival of the arrogance, and the male, the male is The referring to the pure believer, and the corrupted mairi, referring to the confused believer, the secret of the triangle appears in: from them is unjust to its soul and from them and from them and from them With the permission of God, this is the great grace, but the fold of this seven was from those four, and it was not reflected, and it will be taken, and it will be taken.It takes a seventy seventh taken from this, and this is for the pleasure of his knowledge, and ignorant of those who ignored him, yes, in the form of the fallen, the only indication is that in the eye, the eye is in the eye, and the sons in the eye, For this, the hijab was located and the clothes were obtained, and this is what we swear to our proverbs from the secrets of the book of God Almighty, and where is it what appears to the disagreements who are mired from the sailors of the sailor Zamzam his secrets.And for us, the knowledge of the good religion in this denomination is a word that is not in investigator, the lowest imam, as he made the causes of this virginity, so that it is the sacrifice, so that it is a good It is indicated by the coffee, and the gym is the first letter from Hell, and the fear is felt by the treasury, and the Zay and the shin are from the exhalation and the righteous, and the okay is denied, and it is denied, And the first shadow in his saying is up to the Almighty: they went into a shadow with three peoples and also indicating a shadow, and fulfillment of the separation, then he said: If they said: There is no letter Reminded in the name of something that requires a kind of torment, so it does not remain because you are mentioned, so we say: The one is in it is that he said in the description of the hell of Hell: A part of a divided and then the highest seven of the forefathers from this surah, and it is the firsts of the conservative indication of the torment, alerting it to the one who has read it, and the one who reads it, Its truths, it became safe from the seven parties in hell, ended, and he does not hide what is in it, and his answer does not benefit him and does not enrich him, as he said to say: And the eye, the eye, the m, and the guarantee, as the waw is from the wealth, the wasting of humiliation, and the noun from the fire, and the H.And the mim is from the guidance, the guarantee of the Gawashi, and the verses are back, and everyone is in the people of the fire, and the good is in its overthrow as the one who is accredited in the projection God Almighty is not, but with the peace of his peace from what was said, or it is said, I do not go to proud, and he is the master who has become the end of the mourning, As for his attribution (P-38) to the Commander of the Faithful, upon me, he honored God Almighty when he asked Qayer al-Roma, Muwadiah from that, so he did not answer, so he did not.For him, and on the ability of peace, what is the honor of the Emir with the sufficiency of this approach except the alert to the questioners of what is not hidden from you from the secrets, so that it is so, so that it is so, so it is so.This is.(Fifth, its sixth, and its seven), the treasure, the foolishness, and the sufficient, because of the passage of its detection on the curtains, so it is sufficient and sufficient, or because it is not described in the prayer Others, (eight) is the basis, because it is the origin of the Qur’an and the first surah in it, (and the ninth and its adore, and the only one and the second is twenty and the third is the same).Supplication, the surah of the question, and the surah of the question, to show it on that, as for its disgrace on the praise, it is an appearance, and so on the thank you, for the one who is the best of God.To be asian as the mother of the Qur’an and the mother of the book.As for the third of the third, it is the case of the first, but rather the appearance.The third and the four as it is not hidden, (and the fourth is ten and the fifteenth).We seek help, and the following is the twenty -one, the sixteenth and the twelve eighth) is the tenderness, the healing and the healing, and the authentic hadiths of the righteousness ( Ten) the surah of prayer is because it is a duty or a child in it, and the junction is the gold of some of the Mujahidin, and a narration from the one in the nose, and it is said: (I divided the prayer between me and between Abdi Nasfin), and wanted the surah, and the linguistic metaphor for the relationship of the kidneys and parties, or the necessity of the righteousness, as a right Obtained, (and ten) the light for its appearance as a lot The Qur’an, (and the ten and ten) the great Qur’an, which is the back of what we presented, (and the second and ten) are the second seven because it is seven verses with an agreement, and what we have seen.And the saying that it is eight is like saying that it is an abnormal nine that is not packed with, or an illusion from the one, except that some of them are considered The name is a verse without you, and among them is the opposite, and the narration is the second, so the second does not dearely that the adultery of the verse does not suffer from the adultery of the one who is in the way of the path of This section is, and it is praised and repeated in every rak'ah and prayer with a kneeling, or what is noticeable is the most difficult of the prayer, so the one rak'ah is not returned, nor the prayer of the rituals of the ritual.And the prayer of the funeral is a supplication, not a right prayer, and it was said: It was described with that because it is praised by another wall, or because it was two times, or because it is a long time Because it is the word, the more the servant reads a verse that God has permitted, with the news of his act, as in the hadith of the famous, and it was said otherwise, and this is the words of the words From the trimming, and it is necessary to be of praise for the praise of God Almighty, or if he returned from praise for those who recite it, and that you will be from the second This nation and praise be to God for this grace, then the rule in the driver of the Qur’an is like the books, as well as the rituals of Lazakh On the crime, like the migrant, if it cut off a tendency or a firmness, he has breathed from it, and activate the walking, and if the preservation takes the surah, he believed that he was taken from the book of God.It is independent, so he grew up with what he has preserved, and also the sexes if it is folded under it, types and kinds of kindness, it was better than that it would be a single door, with it, with that of that The surah with its inception is miraculous and a signs of God Almighty, and the rule in its color is long and short, it appears to be hidden.The Quranic researcher is the opening of the book in it, so they are more than an angel, but rather from the parents of the Qur’an, which is the narrator, and it is the one who is on the authority of Ali And the most companions, and on the authority of Mujahid that it is a civilian, and it has been separated with that, until it is a matter The kiss was transformed, to know that it is in the prayer as it was, and it was said: Some of it is an angel and some are a civilian, and his weakness is not hidden, and the people of the people have been hidden from the people In the verse of the stone: And we have given you seven of the second and the great Qur’an and it is an angel of the text of the scholars and the narration from Ibn Abbas, and it has no ruling, and there is no ruling for it In the right of the people of Mecca as it was said, because it is based on the fact that the angel was not in the right of the people of Mecca, the famous of its disagreement, and the strongest of the righteous from the ritual They witnessed the revelation and the download, because that is a first place for the interpretation of the second seven with the conquest, and it is if it is correct in the hadiths, except that it is true He is a homes and otherwise its interpretation of the seventh long, and secondly The abstinence of the one who is the one who is the one who has been granted before God, with his gossip, may God bless him and grant him peace be upon him.You have a clear openness, and it is before the conquest in the two years, and the expressing in the past is a realization of the fog.And his arrival in the exposure of the age, and the dominant in it is the precedent of the fall, and the compassion: and do not turn your eyes to what we have enjoyed with the verse, except that it is not the same, and it is not the same.They are indicated only that it was descended with a king, and as for the negation, we will go to the city (P-34) as well, not, because we say: the negation is the origin, and the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the prayer They said in the answer to the symptoms that the descent is an appearance from the world of the unseen to the testimony, and the appearance of it does not accept the release, because the appearance of the appearance of the appearance of the severity The pretext that it was in every vagina, or that it was on a letter once and another one for the arrival of (Malik) and (Malik), or with a peace of time, and a bid, And the narratives are correct for the fall, which is not obligatory, as it is not hidden, and the surah is a matter of faults and other things that are disturbing if it is from the captain, which is the rest, because the rest is, because the rest is, because the rest is, because the rest is, because the rest is, because the rest is, because the rest is, Some of it, and its body if it is from the wall of construction, which is the house or the wall of the city to surround it with its verses, or from the process, and it is the high and the rituals of the rituals of it.And the house is called as the saying of the naps: ؎ Do not see that God gave you a surah that you see every king around it, so that it will be vibrated, and the one who will be killed by the Qur’an.Fateh and a conclusion, and it was said: a transitional sect, to come out of the verse of the Karsi, translated in a way that was established, and the names of the whole have been established with the hadith and the hadeeth, who said: Surah, such as a surah, is mentioned in it, such as, based on what was narrated on the authority of Anas and Ibn Omar from the forbidden from that, he is not accustomed to it, as the hadith of Anas is a weak or a miserable, or a miserable or a man The age of it is based on it, and if it was narrated from it with a true bond, and the conqueror in the original is a row, it was made either for the first thing, to make it a ritual, and it is a ritual Or the exaggeration, and I do not take it with a lamb or a source that was called the first to be called the one who is the one who is a notice of the first, as if it is a notice, as if it is the same, as if it is the same, as if the He attached to him at first, and then by his intercourse, he is attached to the group for being a part of it, as well By his midst, and this is not the first to a few effective in the sources, except that it is first of his being for the family, or a bone, because this is a compassion, and the absence of it The machine does not describe, and the motive is not compared, as the machine is here.An occasion for the illusion that some be uninterrupted, and they are permissible to be for the lineage, that is, the same conquest, with the faces of the most desirable, and the book (and the book) And the conquest of the conquest of the measure to it, not to the destiny between it and between its parts, and it is achieved in the science, the lamp, or the house of the pride, so it is not in the righteousness of the ritual in the sake of this The first, and the first addition from the addition of the name to the name, which is a famous, and the second in the sense of the mother, as in the part of the thing, not in the sense of (from), as in the absence The sheikh of Islam, which is a matter of some in each, said Ibn Kaysan and Al -Sirafi: The collection of adding the part is in the sense (from) Al -Tabadiyyah, but rather in the luminous, and the sacrifice: Likewise, as well as a difference between part and part, and some of them made the addition in the partial partial, and some of them are in general, and the most beautiful, as well as in general.Example, and made it in the divorced woman as a delicacy of Baghdad, a mother and the month does not help him.And for this generous surah is the names that some are reached to a nose and ten years, one of which is the opening of the book, because it is its principle on the path of the righteous, not because it is in the time The learning, and in the reading in the prayer, as the imam al -Sayuti claimed it, nor because it was the first surah that came down as it was said, but the first and the third is because the principle is from the principle of You call for the observance of the synchronization in the rest of the parts of the book from your two, and there is no doubt that the learning and the Nazouli are not as well as the second I know (P-35) that what is meant by the book is not true to the one who is read in the prayer until it is considered a name for it, and it is the beginning of it, That is because it is the first surah that was written in the wave, and it needs a transmission, and if it is correct that it is correct the Qur’an, which is in our Qur’an as in the lap, then the ritual The one was written, and the dominance of the suspicion is another matter, (and the second) is the opening of the Qur’an, because we did the example of the calm with the slander, (and the third and its righteousness) (Do not say one of you, the mother of the book, and he says: the opening of the book), “I do not pray for it, but it has been established in the chapter, it is called it, as it is not hidden from the one, and it is not hidden from the The appetite is a book, a recitation, or a descent on a saying or a prayer in it, and after that it is followed, it is like the mother who forms the child after her, and it is said to the mother, and it is also said to the mother: To present it and follow the army for it, and it is the mother of the villages, or to disobey it as the science said on the purposes of the suffering in the Qur’an from the praise of God, and it is the one who is God.With the matter and the forbidden Worship is from the praise of God because it is to teach, so it is estimated that it is beneficial to it, and the positive matter is that the forbidden is obligatory for the one in the sentence, and we do not see it.The straight path, if I want the religion of Islam, or from the ability to say: in the name of God, and from the last of his comment, or from you who is a good one of you With worship, which is the verification of the slave by the smile of what the master commanded or forbidden, so it is indicated in the sentence that they are worshiped, and he does not respond to the one who is the same It is obligatory after the pronouncement of the pronouncement that the heads of worship are the neutrality, and in the chest, what is guided to it, not the one who has been done.He, peace and blessings be upon him, is the same, and that is sufficient, and the promise and the bounty, and from the saying of the Almighty: You have been blessed with them, or from them The part, and the reward is either that is easy or harmful, and they are the reward and punishment, but the intentions were this because the messengers are the messengers and the abandonment of the books, the mercy of the servants, to what the servants of the servants, to what the servants of the servants, to the servants of the servants, A pension, and a return, and that is known to those who are able to communicate the blessings, and more, and then communicate with what is bound by the bond, and the abandonment of the work, From what is led by it to the return of the attribute, and the prevention of the one who gets the hearts and bodies, and the praise is the branch of the definition of the one who is with it with the sake of the sake, And the beauty, and what is from the transmission, the landing and the recession between the obedient, and the sinner, so the faith entered into God Almighty and his attributes, the prophets, and the restoration of the wise, and the worship of the Communication and communication, and enter into it in the direction of faith in the prophecies, and what is related to it from the book and the angels, as the matter and the forbidden are the rumors of the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the same The belief is included in the restoration, and they are sent to worship, and people are like a hundred camels in which you do not find a place, and they are mostly sent by the desire, and the ritual And fear, the properties and a few are the people and the hippo, for the three of the guidance was made to the reconciliation of the pension and the re -re -is, and I do not confine for you the face of the confusion with this, and the one who does not do so The three are returned to two, so the praise is required to worship, as there is no judgment for the mind, and perhaps he made him a division for him, as a matter Because of the delayed, and the whiteness did not accept that, so he crossed what he crossed from the article, or to show it on the sentence of its suffering from the ruling, the ruling, The rooted paths, and the knowledge of the pricing, the homes of the hardships, and the first (P-36), benefiting from the first surah to the first to the surah to His saying: The Day of Religion and the second is from his saying: We do not worship and after it, and the righteous path On them, etc., in which there is a promise and a return, so they entered it, and the proverbs and the stories that are intended with the preacher, as well as the supplication and the blessing, and this is the sentence of the Qur’an.It is more simplified by this that it is said: It is a disgrace to four types of the sciences that are the areas of religion, (the first) the knowledge of the origins, and its handicapped is the knowledge of God.With his saying: The Lord of the Merciful, the Most Merciful, and the knowledge of the prophets, and it is intended with his saying, the Almighty: You have been blessed with them and the mummy to him.(The second) The knowledge of the vocals, and the worshipers of the worship, which is intended to say it: I do not worship it and it is a minor and financial, and they are separated to the matters of pensioners from the pension The rules, so the branches threatened to reach, (the third) is the knowledge of what it has, and it is the knowledge of the ethical, and the sake of the prayer is to the presence of al -Samadiyyah The fee is in the homes of these high ranks, and the signal is by saying: And we seek help from the righteous, the righteous (the lord), the knowledge of the one) Salaf Al -Da’i and Al -Ashqaya, and what is connected to it from the promise and the return, and it is what is meant by the words of the high You came in simplified from that, and these two sacrifices call for the book of the book on the suffering, or its estimation in the additional installation, and the first face does not, and this is the one who does not.And if it is more accurate and more beautiful, not because it is formed on them that it is stated that the conqueror shall be amended by the two thirds Another third of the reward, which Al -Shihab said, and then he said: It is wondering what was said here that this is because of its insult to the connotation of guarantee, and the commitment, and they are the same, From this, his mercy, may God have mercy on him with what Dilmi narrated in the Faris on the authority of my father Al -Daradaa: In the palm of the balance, the Qur’an was made in the other palm, as the book of the book was made on the Qur’an seven times, so it is only disturbed by the virtue in the reward That is the news of his success, and on the face of the owner of the said, do not oppose, yes, that it is far, and it is possible to fulfill between the two expertise, and it is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who was The reward was doubled second, and no stone on the wide mercy, or by the fact that the article was disturbed to disturb the situation, or that what The whole thing adjusts all its thirds, or by that the Qur’an is in one of the two expertise or in them in the sense of prayer, the same in the saying of the Almighty: Witnesses, and that is different from the conflict of the paths of people in their readers and their prayers, so he can be managed, and on the illness, they are not measured by what was said in the face The light, or because its prohibition is like the prohibition of the Qur’an, or because the people of faith are so far The rituals are because the face of the name does not have to frame it, but I delegate the matter to you, and the peace of God is upon you, (it is not said): If you are the conqueror of the universal, then the universal Of them, the seventh of the ritual rituals, the gym, the gay, the zai, the hook, the shadow, and the fulfillment, because we say: Perhaps that is for the indication that the meanings are not required by the crystal, and the crystal is not required We are short, God Almighty does not look at your images, and it was seven in accordance with the multiplicity of the verse that is denounced by many of the secrets, and it was from the warehousing of the shadow in the shadow The similar one is one of the ills of the light, and it is collected after the projection of the deceased: (a path to the right to hold it) and it is the mauran that is intended to be overlooked by the family The majesty that feels it is the release of what indicates the mercy in Al -Fatihah, but the remaining seven did not fall from this type, so the light of the light does not know that the matter is not He believes in the deception of God except the losing people, and in his words, the Almighty: The forefathers of my servants are that I am the Forgiving, the Most Merciful, and that my torment is the painful torment of a sign and any sign of that The two sentences, on the one that is in the nickname, which is four ten, a masculine (P-37) with its completeness, and the shadowment is removed from it, and the seventh of it, and the seventh of it, Nurani with a shadow, and a pure and pure, referring to the two believers ’divisions, so a believer did not like the light of his faith, the injustice In contradiction between faith and disobedience, it is not guided by its light, "(and the adulterer does not decorate it while he is a believer)" The pure, referring to the pure, forth, from the arrogance of the adoption, and the male is the pure light, referring to the pure believer, and the light to the one The righteous, the secret of the triangle appears in: some of them are unjust to itself, and they are the one who is reluctant, and some of them are preceded by the goodness of God, that is the preference The seventh is the seven of those four, and it was not reflected, so the stabilization will be taken and the fall is proven, or the seventy is taken from this, and this is taken from this, and this is taken from this To make his knowledge, and ignorance of those who ignored him, yes, in the void of the fallen, just a reference to the fact that the Guyg is in the eye, and the eye is in the between, so that this is the case, and this is the case, and this is the case, Our proverb is one of the secrets of the book of God Almighty, and where is what appears to the unlikes who are mired from its seas, who are misleading from the water of its secrets.And for us, the knowledge of the good religion in this denomination is a word that is not in investigator, the lowest imam, as he made the causes of this virginity, so that it is the sacrifice, so that it is a good It is indicated by the coffee, and the gym is the first letter from Hell, and the fear is felt by the treasury, and the Zay and the shin are from the exhalation and the righteous, and the okay is denied, and it is denied, And the first shadow in his saying is up to the Almighty: they went into a shadow with three peoples and also indicating a shadow, and fulfillment of the separation, then he said: If they said: There is no letter Reminded in the name of something that requires a kind of torment, so it does not remain because you are mentioned, so we say: The one is in it is that he said in the description of the hell of Hell: A part of a divided and then the highest seven of the forefathers from this surah, and it is the firsts of the conservative indication of the torment, alerting it to the one who has read it, and the one who reads it, Its truths, it became safe from the seven parties in hell, ended, and he does not hide what is in it, and his answer does not benefit him and does not enrich him, as he said to say: And the eye, the eye, the m and the guy, as the waw is from the wealth, the wasting of humiliation, the noun is from the fire, and the H is from the gums, and the eye is from the torment, and the meme is from the dirt, and the guy is from the The people of the fire, and the benefit is in its overthrow as the one who is in the abuse of that, from the same difference in the first place, that in his words, may God have mercy From what was said, or it is said, I do not go ahead with pride, and he is the master who has become the end of the religion, and the argument of Islam, and the support of his family, and as for his attribution (P-38) (P-38) On the authority of God, the Exalted, and his face, when he asked the Romans to be Muwadiah about that, and he was not answered, and he asked me and he answered, so he did not pray for him, and on the authority of the Lord With the sufficiency of this fate except the alert to the liquids of what is not hidden from you from the secrets, so understand that, and God Almighty takes care of your guidance.(Fifth, its sixth, and its seven), the treasure, the foolishness, and the sufficient, because of the passage of its detection on the curtains, so it is sufficient and sufficient, or because it is not described in the prayer Others, (eight) is the basis, because it is the origin of the Qur’an and the first surah in it, (and the ninth and its adore, and the only one and the second is twenty and the third is the same).Supplication, and Surah Teach the question, and the surah of the question, to show it on that, but its detection on the praise is a show, and so on the thank you, if only God bless you Asman as the mother of the Qur’an and the mother of the book.As for the third of the third, it is the case of the first, but rather the appearance.The third and the four as it is not hidden, (and the fourth is ten and the fifteenth).We seek help, and the following is the twenty -one, the sixteenth and the twelve eighth) is the tenderness, the healing and the healing, and the authentic hadiths of the righteousness ( Ten) the surah of prayer is because it is a duty or a child in it, and the junction is the gold of some of the Mujahidin, and a narration from the one in the nose, and it is said: (I divided the prayer between me and between Abdi Nasfin), and wanted the surah, and the linguistic metaphor for the relationship of the kidneys and parties, or the necessity of the righteousness, as a right Obtained, (and ten) the light for its appearance as a lot The Qur’an, (and the ten and ten) the great Qur’an, which is the back of what we presented, (and the second and ten) are the second seven because it is seven verses with an agreement, and what we have seen.And the saying that it is eight is like a saying that it is an abnormal nine that is not packed with, or an illusion from the one, except that some of them are the one who is the name of the name, without what you have done, The narration, so the second does not sign that the adultery of the verse does not suit the adultery of the connections of the light, on the authority of the Surah of victory, what is from this section, and it is praised and repeated in all the rituals, Or the most emotional, who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is not the one who is the one who is not the one who is the one who is the one who is not the one is the one who does not want to pray, does not want the ritual prayer, and the prayer of the funeral is that there are no disagreement, and the prayer of the funeral is a supplication, and there is no prayer, and it is a prayer.That is because it is praised by another wall, or because it came down two times, or because it is on two sections of supplication and a blessing, or because it is the word of the servant of it.With the news of his verb, as in the Hadith Al -Mashour, it was said otherwise, and these sayings are built on that the second is from the dressing, and the second is from the ritual In it from praise be upon God, or for what was mentioned of the praise for those who recite it, and that it will be from the second because God Almighty has excluded it for this nation and the praise of God, for the mother of God Then the ruling in the mourning of the Qur’an is a light, as the books are a difference of the Lazakhi to be active for the reader, and the most lifted Crossing is like a migrant if he cut off a tendency or a firmness, he has breathed from him, and acts for the walk, and if the preservation takes the surah, he is able to take from the words of God.He grew up with what he has preserved, and the sex is also when it folded under it, types and kinds, it was better than that it would be under it, one door, with the fact that it is the same With its miracle and a miracle and one of the verses of God Almighty, and the rule in its place is long and short, it appears to be hidden.The Quranic researcher is the opening of the book in it, so they are more than an angel, but rather from the parents of the Qur’an, which is the narrator, and it is the one who is on the authority of Ali And the most companions, and on the authority of Mujahid that it is a civilian, and it has been separated with that, until it is a matter The kiss was transformed, to know that it is in the prayer as it was, and it was said: Some of it is an angel and some are a civilian, and his weakness is not hidden, and the people of the people have been hidden from the people In the verse of the stone: And we have given you seven of the second and the great Qur’an and it is an angel of the text of the scholars and the narration from Ibn Abbas, and it has no ruling, and there is no ruling for it In the right of the people of Mecca as it was said, because it is based on the fact that the angel was not in the right of the people of Mecca, the famous of its disagreement, and the strongest of the righteous from the ritual They witnessed the revelation and the download, because that is a first place for the interpretation of the second seven with the conquest, and it is if it is correct in the hadiths, except that it is true He is a homes and otherwise its interpretation of the seventh long, and secondly on the abuse of the two who are given to the distress before his gossip with the fact that God Almighty has blessed God and may God bless him and grant him peace With matters before his giving to you, as he said: “We open up for you, and it is clear, and it is before the conquest in the years, and the abbrection is for the past The disagreement of the phenomenon, especially with the revenue of the mother, and the word (may), and its coldness in the exposure of the time, and the dominant in it is the precedent of the fall, and the kindness: and do not give it to you.However, it was not said that this is not said: This is not indicated that it was descended with Mecca, and as for the negation of its descent in the city (P-33) The negation is the original, and on the prosecutors of the confirmation and that I am, and what they said in the answer to the symptoms that the descent is an appearance from the world of the unseen to the testimony, and the appearance of it is not.The appearance of the appearance of the heroes, as the case of the pretext that it was in every one for a sake, or that it was on a letter again and another other for the (money) With a later, a bid, and with it, and the gathering of doctrines and novels is correct for the fall, which has no obligatory, As it is not hidden, and the surah is a fault and otherwise, if it is from the seam, which is the rest, because the rest of everything is something, and it is from it, and it is from it, The homes or the wall of the city to surround its verses, or from the argument, which is the high and the reinforcement to reiterate it by being the words of God Almighty, and it is called the ritual The saying of the naps: ؎ Do you not see that God gave you a surah that see every king around it, so that a Quran that is covered by a light and a rhetoric, and a seed, is a sect.To come out of the verse of the Karsi, a transgression, and the names of the whole have been established with the hadiths and the antiquities, so whoever says that it is said: a surah, so that it is like that On what was narrated from Anas and Ibn Omar from the forbidden from that, it is not accustomed to it, as the hadith of Anas is weak or a picker, and the hadith of Ibn Umar, and the one who is a son, Correctional, and Al -Fatihah in the original is a row that was made either for the first thing, because it is a median in the openness of all, and the transmission of the transmission, or the exaggeration, or the sake of it.A source that was called the first to be called the source of the source, a notice of his argument, as if it was the same as the conquest, as it is attached to it, and it is related to it With the group, it is part of it, and so is it said in the conclusion, because the last of the last is exposed to the last, and all by its midst, and it is not like this, and it is not like this.However, he is more than his being for the family, or a while, because this is an inherent and comparative act, and the majority is that the machine is not described, and it is not compared to the one, and it is not compared to the one, and it is not compared to it An occasion for the illusion that some be uninterrupted, and they are permissible to be for the lineage, that is, the same conquest, with the faces of the most desirable, and the book (and the book) And the conquest of the conquest of the measure to it, not to the destiny between it and between its parts, and it is achieved in the science, the lamp, or the house of the pride, so it is not in the righteousness of the ritual in the sake of this The first, and the first addition from the addition of the name to the name, which is a famous, and the second in the sense of the mother, as in the part of the thing, not in the sense of (from), as in the absence The sheikh of Islam, which is a matter of some in each, said Ibn Kaysan and Al -Sirafi: The collection of adding the part is in the sense (from) Al -Tabadiyyah, but rather in the luminous, and the sacrifice: Likewise, as well as a difference between part and part, and some of them made the addition in the partial partial, and some of them are in general, and the most beautiful, as well as in general.Example, and made it in the divorced woman as a delicacy of Baghdad, a mother and the month does not help him.This is the generous surah, which is the same as the bit of one and twenty people, one of which is the opening of the book, because it is His principle on the prestigious synthesis, not because it opens it in the teaching, and in the readers in the prayer, as the imam al -Saytouti claimed it, nor because it is the first of the first The first and the third, because the principle is from the knowledge or the descent, the recitation of the observance of the prohibition in the rest of the parts of the book, from the two parts of you The learning and the Nazouli are not like the arranged picnic, and the second is when you know (P-35) that the one who is intended for the book is not in the righteousness of the righteousness in what is in the way of what is in the way of what is in the way The name is its principle for it, and the chair said that it was called that because it was the first surah that was written in the wave, and it needs a transfer, and that it is true, and that it is true, and that it is true, and that it is true, and that it is true, and that it is correct Who is in our Qur’an as in the Law, then maybe the following was written and then the one was written, and the prevalence of the thought is another matter, (second), the opening of the Qur’an, for the sake With the slander, (and its third and its elevation) the mother of the book and the mother of the Qur’an, and the hadith: “(Do not say your mother’s mother, the book, and say: the openness of the book),“ I do not pray for it, but it is in it.She called it it, as it is not hidden from the follower, and it was called that because the appeal is a writer, a recitation, or a descent on the saying, and what is it, and what is it, and what is it, and it is not.Which the boy is formed after it, and it is also said to the way: a mother, to advance it and follow the army for it, and it is the mother of the villages, or to its insults as he said the knowledge of the one who said: The Qur’an is a praise for God Almighty with what is his family, and from worshiping the matter and forbidding, and from the return, but praise is a back, and the worship is for the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is to be It is valued by an affairs that he benefits, and the positive matter is obligated by the prohibition on the opposite in the sentence, and we do not see in it in it, or from the guidance of the righteous path, or from the one who wants it.The estimation of say: in the name of God, and from the last of his comment, or from you, we are worshiped, for it is a news about his specialization with worship, and it is the servitude, and it is the worship of the servants, and it is the worship of the servants, The master or forbids, so it is indicated in the sentence that they are worshiped, and he does not respond to the dismissed That the head of the worshipers, and in the chest what is guided to it, not, and may God bless him and grant him peace be upon him, may God bless him and grant him peace It is sufficient, and the promise and the bounty, who is the saying of the Almighty: You have been blessed with them other than the angry, or from the Day of Religion, that is, the reward, and the reward, or the reward, or the reward, or the reward, or the reward, And punishment, but the intentions were that the messengers are sent and the books are extremely mercy With the knowledge of those who are able to communicate the blessings, and more, then connect to it with what is bound by the bond, and the increased is done to work, and it is permissible, and it will be done, Return the argument, and prevent the argument with hearts and bodies, and the praise is the branch of the knowledge of the one with it with the investigator, and the introduction of the knowledge is entered by the majesty, Sending, removing, and recklessness between the obedient, and the sinner, so the faith entered into God Almighty and his attributes, prophets, and the re -of the bulls, and worship, and the one who can be able to be able to do.It enters into it from the face of faith in the prophecies, and what is related to it from the book, and the angels, as the matter and the end are the providence of that in the sentence, and the one who is the one, And they are sent to worship, and people are like a hundred camels in which there is no place in it, and they are mostly sent by desire and dread, and their mediators are the hope, the righteousness, the goodness, the goodness, the goodness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the righteousness, the ritual, People and the hippo, for three guidance to the interest of pension and repetitions, and I do not confine to you the face of the confusion with this, so the mockery of the mortar, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, and for you, So the praise is perpetuated in worship, as there is no judgment for the mind, and perhaps he made him a crop for him, asking that the thanks of the blessing, and the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind, And the whiteness did not accept that, so he crossed what he crossed from the article, or to disobey it on the sentence of its suffering from the theory wisdom, and the rulings of the path, the rulings of the path, And the view of the tranquility of the pricing, the homes of the hardships, and the first (P-36) is beneficial from the first surah to its saying: the Day of Religion and the second is from the saying of it: And the righteous paths of the straight path, from its saying: the guidance of the verse, and the view of its saying: You have been blessed with them, etc.With it, preaching, as well as supplication and praise, and this is the sentence of Quranic.The areas of religion, (the first) is the knowledge of the origins, and its contract is the knowledge of God Almighty, and his attributes, and the signal is by saying: the Lord of the two worlds, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.By saying the Almighty: You have been blessed with them and the mummy to him by saying the Almighty: Malik on the Day of Religion.(The second) The knowledge of the vocals, and the worshipers of the worship, which is intended to say it: I do not worship it and it is a minor and financial, and they are separated to the matters of pensioners from the pension The rules, so the branches threatened to reach, (the third) is the knowledge of what it has, and it is the knowledge of the ethical, and the sake of the prayer is to the presence of al -Samadiyyah Restoration in The homes of these high ranks, and the indication of it with his saying: And you seek help from the straight path (the lord), know the stories and the people of the sake And the hardships, and what is connected to it from the promise and the return, and it is intended to say it to the Almighty: You have been blessed with them other than those who are angry with them, and if you are not lost That is, and these two sacrifices call for the book of the book on the suffering, or its appreciation in the additional composition, and the first face does not require it, and from this, it is the same.No, because it is formed on them that it is stated that the conqueror adjusts the two thirds of the Qur’an, as it removes it if it proves that the talcum is not equal to detail, so the increase in the buildings of the buildings is a place From the reward, Al -Shihab said, and then he said: It is surprising that it was said here that this is because of its insults on the connotation of guarantee, and commitment, and they are the third of the connotations, and I say: May God have mercy on him with what Al -Dawli narrated in the Faris on the authority of Abu al -Darada: The Qur’an was made in the other palm, as the book of the book on the Qur’an is seven times, for it is only one of the preferences in the reward, so he will rejoice He promoted him, and on his face, the owner of the gossip does not oppose, yes, that it is distant, and it is possible to separate between the two experts, and with it the forms of the first and the first of the first, and the first of the first, and the first of the first A stone on the wide mercy, or by the fact that the essay is disturbed to disturb the situation, or by that what the whole thing is amended by all of it Prayer, the same in his saying: The Qur’an is the Qur’an.Let him manage, and on the ills, it is not measured by what was said in the face of the name with that, because it is the best of the light, or because it was forbidden as the forbidden of the Qur’an, or the sake of the Qur’an, or the sake of the Qur’an.Faith is to it, or because it is a judge, and the arbitrators are the mother of the book, and I do not subjugate some of the integrity of the rituals because the face of the name is not obligatory, and it is not necessary for you And peace be upon you, (it is not said): If the conqueror is a gathering because of the suffering of the book, then the seven of it fell from the righteousness of the fruit, the gym, the goodness, the Zayy, the shin, and the shame.That is for the indication that the meaning of the mean is not obligated by the acre.The most disturbing of the secrets, and it was from the dark letters that were not found in the similar The illusion of the light, and the whole after the dropping of the deceased: (a path to the right to hold it), which is the Nurani, which is interested in it with its conqueror's family to the sign of the majestic to the greatness of the The feeling of it is the release of what indicates the mercy in the Fatwa, but the remaining seven did not fall from this type, so the light is disturbed, and it is not a matter The abundance of God is only the losing people, and in the words of the Almighty: the forefathers of my servants are that I am the Forgiving, the Most Merciful, and that my torment is the painful torment of a sign and any sign of that of the one who is the same In the form of the Nuraniya, which is four ten, a male (P-37) with its perfection, and the shadow is removed from it, and if the one is tubed, the one is clear.Owner, and a pure and pure, referring to the two believers, so a believer has not likened the light of his faith the injustice Faith and disobedience, so do not warm its oppression, “(and the adulterer does not adhere to a believer)” To the cordial oppressor, who is the one who is cursed, the male is the pure light, referring to the pure believer, and the granted and the shameful, referring to the believer, The secret of the triangle in: Some of them are unjust to itself, and they are the one who is confronted, and some of them are the ones who are good for the good of God, that is the great preference.That four, and it was not reflected, and the stabilization will be taken and the fall is fixed, or it will take a seventh seven, and it is taken from this, and this is for the sake of his knowledge.Yes, in the form of the fabrics, just a sign that the guarantee is in the eye, and the two eyes are in the between, for this, the hijab has fallen and the clothes were harvested, and this is what is clear to us, Where is what appears to those who are mired from his seas, who are prejudiced from the water of his secrets.And for us, the knowledge of the good religion in this denomination is a word that is not in investigator, the lowest imam, as he made the causes of this virginity, so that it is the sacrifice, so that it is a good It is indicated by the coffee, and the gym is the first letter from Hell, and the fear is felt by the treasury, and the Zay and the shin are from the exhalation and the righteous, and the okay is denied, and it is denied, And the first shadow in his saying is up to the Almighty: they went into a shadow with three peoples and also indicating a shadow, and fulfillment of the separation, then he said: If they said: There is no letter Reminded in the name of something that requires a kind of torment, so it does not remain because you are mentioned, so we say: The one is in it is that he said in the description of the hell of Hell: A seven part of The forefathers of this surah, which are the first to be given to the torment, alerted it to those who have read this surah, and believed in it, and know its truths, and it became safe, and it became safe, He ended, and he does not hide what is in it, and his answer does not benefit him and does not enrich him, as he said to say: Let the darkening, wow, noun, b, eyes, and the eye, From the humiliation, the noun is from the fire, and the hm is from the domain, the eye is from the torment, the mate is from the guidance, the richness of the Gawashi, the verses are back, and everyone is in the people of the fire, and it is in the ritual in the The projection of that is not a difference in the first place, on the authority of his words, may God have mercy The master, who has become the end of the religion, the pretext of Islam, and the support of his family, and his attribution (P-38) to the Commander of the Faithful, upon the end of God.Romans are coming out of that, and he was not obligated, and he asked me and he answered, so he does not pray for him, and on the ability of peace, then what is permitted by the one who is satisfied with this For the means of what is not hidden from you from the secrets, then understand that, and God Almighty takes care of your guidance.(Fifth, its sixth, and its seven), the treasure, the foolishness, and the sufficient, because of the passage of its detection on the curtains, so it is sufficient and sufficient, or because it is not described in the prayer Others, (eight) is the basis, because it is the origin of the Qur’an and the first surah in it, (and the ninth and its adore, and the only one and the second is twenty and the third is the same).Supplication, the surah of the question, and the surah of the question, to show it on that, as for its disgrace on the praise, it is an appearance, and so on the thank you, for the one who is the best of God.To be asian as the mother of the Qur’an and the mother of the book.As for the third of the third, it is the case of the first, but rather the appearance.The third and the four as it is not hidden, (and the fourth is ten and the fifteenth).We seek help, and the following is the twenty -one, the sixteenth and the twelve eighth) is the tenderness, the healing and the healing, and the authentic hadiths of the righteousness ( Ten) the surah of prayer is because it is a duty or a child in it, and the junction is the gold of some of the Mujahidin, and a narration from the one in the nose, and it is said: (I divided the prayer between me and between Abdi Nasfin), and wanted the surah, and the linguistic metaphor for the relationship of the kidneys and parties, or the necessity of the righteousness, as a right Owner, (and ten) The light is for its appearance as a lot of sovereignty, or for its hearts of the hearts of its destiny, or because it is because it was comprehensive of the suffering of the meaning, The twenty) The great Qur’an, which is an apparent from what we presented, (and the second and ten) the second seven because it is seven verses with agreement, and what we have seen is the one who is common to it.Eighth is like a saying that it is an anomalous nine that is not packed with, or an illusion from the one, except that some of them are the one who promised the name, without you The second is that the adultery of the verse does not suit the adultery of the corruption of the light, that in the Surah al -Nasir what is from this section, and it is praised and passed in every rak'ah and a prayer with a kneel The most difficult of the prayer, so the single rak'ah does not want the prayer of the funeral that in the bodies is disturbed, and the prayer of the funeral is a supplication, there is no ritual prayer, and it was said: In another wall, or because it has come down two times, or because it is on two sections of supplication and praise, or because it is the same as the servant reads from it, and it is a good thing for it.The famous hadith, and it was said otherwise, and these sayings are based on the second of the chain of transmission, and it is necessary to be from the praise of the praise of the ritual And when he returned from praise for those who recite it, and that it is from the second because God Almighty has excluded it for this nation and praise to God for this ritual The Qur’an is like the books, a dispute of the Zerki, that it is active for the reader, and the most brought up as the
