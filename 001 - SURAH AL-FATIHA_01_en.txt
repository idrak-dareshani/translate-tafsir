Ba'al -ul -Ba'at -ul -Fitr, Allah Rabbana Yasar Lena Lana Kalah and Tambul -e -Bala -e -Fakhnak and Al -Muqabalin Amen, or the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Earlier, I have come to the age that now my age is enough.Lunar lunar 68 mars have been diligently and the disorders of different snakes are also packed by me.As much as ever, the Cros References, which are not the same as the Holy Qur'an, is not as ever, but the fact is that my tongue sometimes fits because the medicines I have to use also have an impact on the nerves, and those who have our freedom are still influenced by Allah.He has recited Surah Fatiha and he said, "This Surah Mubarak is the first Surah in terms of wiping, but also note that it is also the first complete Surah, which is visible to the Holy Prophet.The five verses of the beginning of the Surah Madasar are almost the same as that it is Surah al -Fatihah and it is a complete Surah which means that the Holy Prophet, the meaning of Surah Al -Fatihah, means that the meaning of Surah Fatehah Yatu means to open the Qur'an by the Qur'an, as the Qur'an is in the Holy Qur'an.It was the temperament that he had many names of what he had specially loved.There are many names.Surah Al -Fatiha is the most common, but at least the four names I think every Muslim should know more, and many names have some differences in this regard.And the Qur'an of Basra is also that the verse Bismillah is also included in Surah Al -Fatihah.The Qur'an of Hanifa Rahmatullah and the Qur'an which was the Qur'an is Bismillah Na Surah Fatiha Qajooz.The Queen was written to the Queen.They are considered to be included in the verse that is only in the verse of the Qur'an, as the only sign that a new Surah is being started from here.Except for this, the Hadith is given to the Hadith of the Holy Qur'an.What I will tell you is the Qur'an in it.For the sake of keeping in your mind and in your heart, then it is one of the points and the other is not part of it.It is not part of the confidence that it is necessary to read Surah Mubarak in prayer.It has been raised, but three are extremely extreme and it is like the Hanafi that if you are praying from the part of the different part of the Imam, you will not have any Surah Fatiha in any of the rak'ahs.Ra'a'an is the Imam of the Imam Malik, who is the Salvi Rakat, in which the Imam is also reading the secret of the Mu'addis, which is also read aloud, in which the Imam is reading aloud, in which the Muqaddis should be pleased to hear full attention when they should be heard.If you are going, focus on reading it and be self -conscious.This is the third reason in my own attitude.The most is the most complicated and there is no complication in it.I am present at the Potashli, which is the Qur'an or the books of Allah, they are attributed to them, which is the epitome of the inside, which is the conscious consciousness, and then that they do it.The fact that the human being, without the guidance of the Prophet himself, uses the teaching of a prophet without the guidance of himself, and that the facts are the number one that is the creator of this universe.The results will be brutal.These two things are mentioned in the explanation of what is mentioned in Lakman, where the personality of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) is mentioned, but only to know that the philosophy of the Qur'an is that in every human being, who is Muslim at the time of his birth, he is born in the nature of Islam.If you are working on the right direction, then the man will reach himself for these two facts, but after reaching these two facts, he will now pray that, O Lord, give more guidance now, so that I do not do what I do in my apple, I can think of something good when I understand something good.It has reached itself to the end and thinks that the Lord I recognize that He is the Creator of this universe and the Lord and the Lord.Read Mubarak that you have reached this place with the blessings of Allah that you have recognized Allah and knows His humiliation.All his attributes have come to fruition.Do not say that I will ever go on a pathway on a path, and the little ones that are divine will destroy my path of my way.One of the luxurious patrolsballs, Rahm Dusro, is the only way to go a little bit of a pillow, but you will go a little bit.Let's go, in terms of the wisdom and philosophy of the Qur'an, the place of this Surah Gabbar is now.We start Bismillah al -Rahman al -Rahim.The continuation of these two cafes is a time in the mercy of Allah that we cannot see.We see the sea.The sea is the sea.It is in it.Poofan is looking at it.He is walking calmly.We are restless.There is a straightforward time, which is why every other understanding between them will come somewhere.But a word comes in the words.It is not enough for Qali Tariyeh Allah.You can do something that is good, good is good, by any means you are not getting any benefit from its beauty, it is very beautiful, it is fine, you are beautiful, thank you, thank you.Praise be to the place of thanksgiving, hungry, eat, eat here.Look here.We cannot do as much history as it is, but His blessings and rewards are so much on us that we cannot count them, so we have given the same kind of praise with Ali Flam, the Lord of the Worlds and tomorrow is thankful to Allah that the Lord of all the worlds is the Lord of the Lord and the Lord is the Lord of the Lord.If you want it, it is not much to increase.If they find it, they are found to be a fading of each other.Rahim is now.Now I will not recite it again.The owner is the sovereign of the Day of Religion.The religion says in Arabic.What should he get revenge whether his evil is heavy that he should get the sight or his goodness and goodness is heavy that he should be rewarded with his name and Ikram.He was one day.The book will be attended with Allah and there is a reckoning, and in thirty, the authority of this calculation is Allah, that is, by making someone else in your mind, you will live in your mind that he will save me or he is so strong that he will save me from his heart.Who has the authority to this day, and then it will be said that the Divine Reception for Allah, which is fully shaded, is just a matter of time for Allah.It is still being said that it is being spoken in a strange way.What is the meaning of Ayaka, which is the connotation of the Foul, in which it is brought to the forefront of the beast.We do not worship you.We will worship you and translate it.If you translate it in the future, it is a matter of fact.May Allah bless us when we say these words, then we are fulfilling that we are doing it, and all of them are doing so as far as the future is concerned.We have reached the light of both of them.Now we have the need.What is the need?What is the direction of the path to the path of the path to us, we understand two things on the straight path.How many stages come to the human being at the infrastructure level.The fact is that the minor should not show the way to the minor humanity.On the general sovereignty level, there is a balance of rights and powers between men and women.It is impossible to balance.Man or woman is a woman or a woman.In whatever he is making about himself, he will keep his mother in it.He can be the same entity, both of whom the male is also the woman and both of them love both.Both have the good of both.Lord they want to mourn both.Likewise, art and society or state government and state always want all of us to be freed.Now you should see how many faders are going on in the world.Freedom Freedom Freedom is really a place in its place.People should have freedom, but the freedom of the people is that the world becomes free to be free.No law is any moral boundary, where they have a freedom and where they have a freedom.They could not be bailable humans.Only Allah can give the system for him.The third problem is the head and the Mahant.Some are doing some products.Now, what has happened in it is how much of the head should be and how much the labor should be, even for the sake of the labor, it is not for the sake of being a bull, and the poor rescue laborer has saved the farmer if he does not give it a right to this.If the head is shrinking, it will be shrinking.He will not come to the forefront.What to do is to keep Abdullah (peace be upon him).These are the three problems.Sada and Mukhtar Absolute is Allah for this day, then to make this authority, then the prayers of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Someone asked you a address.But keep on guidance, no matter what the devil's attack was attacked.If you enter the jinn, the praise that will be in their tongue will happen at this time.What is the guidance that we have reached here and we cannot reach every day.Surah Al -Nasab will receive the four classes of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).Of the Prophets, the Prophets are also the ones who are the messengers in the Uloh -ul -Azam, but they are the four classes.You have not been angry and it is anger that those who abandon the guidance after the guidance are clear.The abducted person who has been guided by the guidance has been recognized, then because of his mischief, because of his selfishness, his jealousy, because of his jealousy, gives him a great deal of revelation.The Tarani Tanji Psalm Sixty Sixes have been used in the prophets for 1400 years.In the same way, a person becomes mad in love and love, he also calls the bride, that is, the emotions have become so heartbroken.Someone has become so heartbroken.And this is Surah Doha.Often people will remember the people, so it is not necessary to understand the word Dawal in it, but also the one who is still trying to seek it in seeking the path of the path, and the one who is disobedient to the truth because of a confusion, it is a bad thing.
